[735] Two gazes (4)
* * *
Labyrinth Andre – World No. 1.
Sirone’s body began to spread out into the world, radiating the brilliance of a huge cross.
It was a sacrifice to revive countless beings who had disappeared as history was twisted.
‘The life that has passed, and the life that will be born in the future.’
everyone is precious
Looking at Sirone, who was gradually disappearing into the light, Kara Torsa, the martial arts dragon, lowered her body.
“Because of you, we will exist.”
Numerous dragons floating in the sky descended behind Kara Torsa and imitated his actions.
“Because of you, we will exist.”
Mitochondrial Eve shed tears.
“Sirone… … .”
With this, history will return to its place, and she too could later become the empress of the empire.
“Remember this light, Blitz.”
Catching the particles of light that filled the sky in her eyes, Kara Torsa delivered the message to Blitz.
“This is life.”
Blitz didn’t answer, but the current memory would endure in his head for an eternity without being transformed.
Labyrinth Andre – World No. 283.
As God’s punishment struck, the bodies of the army ants that invaded the Garnet Kingdom were shattered.
“No, wizard.”
When Merott’s antennae trembled in fear, Sirone pet her.
“are you okay. There is nothing to be afraid of.”
This world is someone’s dream.
So, Sirone could have closed her eyes and turned away from all of this right now.
‘but… … .’
If even the desire for happiness is an illusion, what is the reason for being born in this world in the first place?
“Everything will be fine.”
The place Syrone took with Merott was the room where the owner of the Garnet Kingdom, the queen, was.
“The thirteenth night… … !”
Upon reaching the entrance, Merrott shouted.
“No one can access it!”
On the 13th night, rolling on the floor while activating incarnation, half of the six legs had already disappeared.
“Yes, I know.”
Sirone lovingly watched the thirteenth night of a desperate struggle against the mighty army ants.
To him, Garnet is just one of many objects with biologically similar information… … .
“That is why it exists.”
We are meant to love those who are like us, and will forever stretch out into a wider world.
“Kuaaaaa!”
The screams of the 13th night from being surrounded by army ants spread throughout the cave.
Garnet, unable to get out of the Queen’s room, was only trembling in front of the deaths of her children.
‘pain. Terrible pain.’
Nevertheless, we would continue our journey for happiness by endlessly repeating feeding and breeding.
‘Yes, that’s fine.’
“mother! mother!”
The 13th night, crushed by the army ants, shouted as Merott rushed at it, bursting with pheromones of anger.
“Do not come! Get out of here!”
Merott had a mission to safely escape the colony and create a new colony.
Sirone understood the feelings of all of them.
‘Because the life of an insignificant creature is no different.’
Immortal function.
As Sirone’s body emitted an intense light, the ants that filled the cave stopped fighting at the same time.
“This… … .”
It was the light of life.
* * *
“What, what?”
As 19,000 crosses filled Andre’s labyrinth, Kido looked around with a frightened expression.
“What happened? Why suddenly?”
What was really serious was that Sirone’s body, currently in the labyrinth, was also shining in the same form.
The voice finally realized.
‘Could it be that I was exploring all of Andre’s world?’
It was not an impossible task for Sirone, who controls time as vocal sounds control space.
However, the more I thought about it, the more I was shocked to think that I had surpassed my own pace while wandering around 19,000 worlds.
“this… … ! I will collapse!”
It was only a matter of time before the cave’s ground collapsed when the entrances to numerous worlds exploded simultaneously.
‘No, it’s not on that level.’
If you recall why it was called a space-time prison in the first place, time and space would be jumbled together.
“You must avoid it!”
The moment Seong-eum opened her eyes and was about to cast an etheric wave.
“Time-space prison.”
Nane muttered indifferently.
‘The 19,000 worlds defined by McLean Guffin.’
It was Nane who swallowed Ankera’s dream, but only vague assumptions about Guffin were possible.
‘It is being integrated again.’
Nane stepped into an impossible situation without fully realizing Guffin’s intentions.
“What are you dreaming about?”
I couldn’t help but ask.
“In this nightmare where only a terrible extinction awaits, what kind of hope do you have?”
Nane held out her hand slowly.
“You must be wrong.”
Sermon – end.
A red sword with the concept of annihilating the universe soared through the ceiling and plunged to the ground at the speed of light.
The vertical flash was so fast that it seemed to connect the ground and the sky, so no reaction was possible.
“Keugh!”
Even so, the reason why Kido’s moans were heard was that Nane’s truth did not penetrate the ground.
“how?”
During Nane’s sermon, the bell was trembling just above the ground as if something had blocked it.
The voice’s head turned slowly.
“Sirone.”
Tears welled up in her eyes as she watched Sirone’s body becoming transparent like clear water.
“Until the end… … .”
If Nane’s Kar was perfect, there would be no life in this universe that could deny his truth.
However, the fact that the bell was not inserted meant that there was still another opinion that denied Nane’s enlightenment.
“I want to live.”
The life force that Sirone was spreading was preventing Nane from reaching perfection.
Tears flowed down her cheeks.
“I was stupid.”
The strong and the weak are all nothing but a dice game endlessly circling the cycle of life.
That’s why Sirone was willing to sacrifice herself for the sake of life itself to prevent the destruction of the universe.
“no.”
Seongeum shook her head and wept.
“You shouldn’t leave like that, Sirone.”
She was blocking Nane’s truth with her brilliant will, but in the end, Sirone would spread infinitely.
“You are wrong, Sirone.”
As Nane pressed her palms down, the sermon bell began wriggling terribly toward the ground.
“Aww!”
At the same time, the light of the cross emitted by Sirone became more intense, but this only accelerated its extinction.
“You cannot save the world with fleeting hope.”
If the world’s pain disappeared just by loving something, Nane would have given away his body thousands of times.
“Human emotions are nothing but a mirage after they pass. Who will remember you?”
Being alive is so natural for life that no one will honor Sirone.
“From a distance, it’s just that each other is pushing burdens on each other and turning pain away.”
They reincarnate infinitely, and that’s why everyone suffers.
“I will hang up.”
As Sirone’s spirit faded, the bell of Nane’s sermon pierced the ground with terrifying momentum.
“Is it over… … .”
At that time, Mungyeong muttered with a pale face, I heard Sirone’s voice, now dissolving like smoke.
“Even if life has no meaning, I will protect it until the end in this nightmare.”
“why? In a world that ends when you close your eyes, why bother to endure the pain?”
“There is no reason.”
Isn’t it enough to just love?
“we are… … .”
When Sirone’s body, which had completely spread out in light, disappeared, her voice hovered around the space like an hallucination.
-Because it exists for no reason.
“no! Sirone!”
Seongeum ran and struggled through the space that had been spread out with light, but nothing was caught.
“No reason?”
The existence that stood in my way disappeared, but he did not completely strike down the end of the sermon.
“Sirone, that is more than any truth I know… … .”
It was an incorrect result.
“Is that enlightenment? Are you saying that’s really the guffin’s intention? To live for no reason, die for no reason, reproduce for no reason, and eat without a reason?”
No answer came back.
It was frustrating for Nane, but it was devastating sadness for everyone who knew Sirone.
Kido lowered his head.
“Is it over now?”
“no.”
On the other hand, Rian was still burning with fighting spirit, staring into the void where Sirone had disappeared.
“It can’t disappear like this.”
The yaksha’s will is strong enough to deny the reality, but he couldn’t revive Sirone with Denai.
“Give up. Sirone has become infinite.”
Seong-eum looked back at the transparent air surrounding her with sad eyes.
It has become such a huge spirit that is everywhere but nowhere, and has completely permeated the world.
you said
“Don’t be sad. Since this is also just a dream, what is the reason to exist and bear the sorrow?”
Nane put her hand on the handle of the sermon bell and pressed it hard with all her weight.
“This is the end.”
Anyone watching the end of the universe could not help but feel dizzy, and Mungyeong closed her eyes tightly.
“why… … .”
I heard your voice.
When everyone checked there, the sword of the apocalypse was slowly pushing through Nane’s palm and rising up.
“Why can’t I get it through?”
Still, Nane’s curl wasn’t perfect.
“You mean there is still a denial of my truth?”
“Rian! excuse me… … !”
Faint particles of light were gathering one by one in front of Kido’s point.
“It is not over.”
As world number 2940 exploded with a bang, more light particles began to gather.
Subsequently, world #8765 exploded, world #32, world #10837, world #8546, world #4109… … .
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
When 19,000 worlds were simultaneously liberated, a group of lights began to take human form.
He said in a trembling voice.
“Not one.”
The immortal function, which started from the samadhi of fear, broke each world and went back.
Kido cried out in tears.
“Sirone eh!”
Light has no will.
Therefore, the reason why a phenomenon that is merely a condensation of photons can accurately assemble the shape of Sirone… … .
“Hexa.”
Because the cause doesn’t exist.
“Great!”
As the infinitely spread mind formed a body again, Sirone put on a painful expression.
“You’re back! Sirone is back!”
It’s good news for those who have been waiting, but the process of degrading from a supreme spirit to a creature was terrifying for the person concerned.
‘Feeding and breeding.’
However, since it had already been experienced, the process of installing the biological system was more flexible than before.
“It’s me, and your sympathy for the world is not wrong. But we will exist to the end.”
The vocal sound, which confirmed Sirone’s clear eyes, trembled as if he couldn’t understand it.
“Speak, nonsense. That… … .”
It is impossible.
Seongeum, the same Unlocker, knew better than anyone else that an infinitely expanded mind could not return.
‘No, just one thing… … .’
Seongeum, thinking of the only way out, stared at Sirone with a shocked expression.
Infinite Wizard.

[736] Two gazes (5)
‘really… … .’
Was it possible?
Guffin is a name that only exists as a hypothesis to many wizards because it has already been erased.
Infinite Wizard.
No one can guess what it is, but the head of Jincheon Space Agency had evidence that it actually existed.
“Did it contain the entire universe?”
Nane’s question was indifferent, but there was an emotion of anticipation in his eyes.
“What did you realize?”
Sirone opened her arms and said.
“life.”
all life in the universe.
“It is not a sin to exist, it is me.”
Even in the same language, the words Sirone spoke had different depths, and it was me who understood them.
“If all we have to do is suffer just because we were born, if our destiny is to reincarnate forever in the bondage of cowardice… … .”
Sirone cried.
“Because that is so sad.”
Disappointment flashed in Nane’s eyes.
“Is it only the heart that you got from the universe? Rather, isn’t that heart the source of suffering?”
“It’s not something we can do anything about. No matter how big the universe is, it is not bigger than the heart of a mother who loves her children.”
can you deny
“The mind transcends the universe.”
Nane, who almost realized all the reasoning, tried his best to chew on Sirone’s words.
“When the universe disappears, the mind also disappears.”
It exists because it has a mind.
“You may be right at first glance, but you are almost wrong, Sirone.”
Another sword was born while the sword containing Nane’s sermon, the concept of the end to end the universe, was still pointing toward the ground.
“God is indifferent.”
An iron-colored sword that removes all emotions in this world, heartlessness surged above his head and was absorbed into the sword of the end.
As Nane’s will grew stronger, the ground trembled, and the feeling of the end of the world rushing into my skin.
Mungyeong gritted his molars.
“damn! How are you going to stop that?”
Nane’s sword painting was pressuring the world in the realm of concepts that transcended phenomena.
“It is not selfishness that I do not back down. Do you know how many lives will be driven into suffering by the love you have realized? It is pain without cost. Aren’t they pitiful?”
Only 0.00001 nanometers left until the end of the universe.
“It has no beginning and no end, just reincarnation. Is it unreasonable to put an end to eternally recurring suffering?”
99.9999… … Nane’s exact number of karma, which was running in percent, was extending to 184,000 decimal places.
Sirone said.
“Because it’s not our fault.”
There is no original sin in existence, even if it is man-made good and evil and man-made pain.
That’s why Sirone has no cause… … .
“I am in love.”
By forgiving the sins of all those present, it came to negate Nane’s merit.
“He is also empty.”
Dozens of swords spread out from behind Nane and rushed towards Sirone.
Destruction, extinction, dissolution… … All the concepts necessary to erase a being were being shot.
At the same time, the entrance to World No. 1 exploded.
“Huh!”
As the quantum information tunnel that transcends time and space was opened, the realization of fraternity flooded in.
Then, Sirone’s Kar value, which was well over 90 percent, began to drop rapidly.
Kar value 86.24 percent.
There is no purpose because he sacrificed everything, and what remains is just pure emotion.
‘love.’
The 283rd world entrance exploded, causing the Kar reading to plummet to 74.31%.
Towards the life that will exist in the future, good and evil, absolute fraternity without trivial or grandiose things.
The entrance to World 847 exploded.
“Ah ah ah ah ah!”
Carr number 49.24 percent.
Sirone’s spirit had been degraded to the level of an animal, but that’s why it was clear what we had to have until the end.
Carr number 24.11 percent.
What is needed to achieve perfect love is a supreme and pure feeling that does not discriminate against any being.
‘It’s not empty, it’s me!’
Nane is almost right, but even in a world where suffering is everything, the reason we must exist is… … .
‘The mind is bigger than the universe.’
Because we are so precious to us.
Carr number 1.4 percent.
“Sirone… … .”
Looking at Sirone, who was shedding bloody tears from his bloodshot eyes, everyone put on a terrified expression.
No one knows what’s happening to Sirone, just like the Infinite Wizard can’t understand it, but one thing was clear.
“What a great thing… … I am carrying it.”
Carr’s figure 0.24 percent.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
From animals to plants, from plants to insignificant things, from insignificant things to the lowest phase with nowhere to go.
But that’s why I can love you.
‘Everything.’
Kar value 0.0000017 percent.
“It’s a big deal! Andre is going to collapse!”
After passing through the entrance of World 9999, 10,000 worlds exploded one after another, and the ceiling began to collapse.
“Why give false hope?”
The bell of Nane’s sermon advanced towards the land, spreading a tremendous wind pressure.
“How can you not know that the hope you give is the seed of suffering?”
“That pain… … .”
Kar value 0.0000000000000001 percent.
“It is proof of existence.”
As the Karuchi plummeted toward zero, the standard for Sirone’s mind disappeared.
There is no subjectivity whatsoever.
For him who distributes equal love to all things, senses are no longer the criterion for judgment.
‘Combined.’
As time and space, sense of time and depth were integrated, a new sense completely occupied his mind.
The eighth sense that living things can have, Superquality.
All the information delivered through super senses seemed to expose the reality of this world.
‘idea.’
Those who sense the truth cannot have subjectivity.
“get out! If you don’t leave now… … !”
Finally, as World 19000 exploded, Andre’s trapped time and space were completely released.
Space-time was jumbled up and was about to engulf everyone, then the vocal sound cast an etheric wave.
“I will stop you.”
Numerous events transcending time and space began to overlap beyond the barrier of space she had spread.
“damn! Isn’t this complete hell?”
No one could have predicted what would happen if they were swept away by a space-time storm.
At a time when everyone couldn’t dare to go out of the space of voice, I caught a glimpse of Sirone and Nane standing face to face in a jumble of events.
“Can you hold on?”
Nane, whose Carsuchi is close to perfect, guessed why Sirone was not swept away by the space-time storm.
Said Sirone, who was enveloped in light.
“Would this have been the answer you wanted?”
As the light blocking space-time expanded into a giant sphere, the space-time storm was torn to shreds.
“Princess! They are disappearing!”
The sword of the sermon was scattered like ashes in the cluster of lights that spread out like an explosion, and the scenery of reality finally came into view.
“I blew it all away.”
There was not even a trace of Andre’s cave, and the structures that were created as tourist attractions were not visible.
The light that spread toward Sirone, standing in the middle of the endless desert, began to be sucked in.
“I-that… … .”
The light enveloped the brain, the source of the spirit, and the droplets of light that were pale but did not feel cold were flickering endlessly.
Nane, who had been watching the sword of the sermon being destroyed, slowly turned her gaze to Sirone.
“Is it Yahweh?”
The name of the special light that arises from the senses beyond cognition was omnipotence that only infinite wizards that contain all the information in the world could use.
“It is not unfair.”
Since no one with a higher Kar value than Nane exists in the world, there is no one who can deny him.
“But I cannot deny you.”
The only truth has not yet been established in this world.
“Now I see, why I can’t be a god.”
Guffin didn’t leave questions.
“Arian Sirone.”
No, the very existence of Hexa was the final barrier to the perfect truth.
Sirone and Nane, Nane and Sirone.
“I think it’s a ball.”
The universe is full of futility.
“It is love.”
The mind transcends the universe.
Both of them knew that it was just a dream, but the two eyes looking at the same truth were so extreme.
“contradiction. No one can get the right answer.”
Sirone’s Kar of the prejudice disappeared was too weak, but it was also the only point that Nane could not reach.
“I can never be right.”
Nane’s fingertips pointed at Sirone.
“Are you saying you can never be wrong?”
Thus, creatures still have to worry endlessly about the value of existence in the lowest phase of the universe.
“But two standards cannot exist. If you and I coexist, countless lives will suffer.”
“I have no intention of backing down.”
“… … .”
Mahagaruta said that Nane’s enlightenment was the extreme of the exact opposite union that came after mastering his own enlightenment.
However, Sirone’s realm was shining at the exact opposite point that Nane could never reach.
“Sirone, as much as you have mercy on life, I also have sympathy for them.”
It was true.
“That’s why no one can yield. As long as one or the other does not disappear, the suffering of this world will continue.”
When Nane spread her arms in the posture of shooting a bow, a huge sword with tremendous power was born.
“so… … .”
When Nane turned around and opened her arms, an iron-colored sword was born drawing an arch.
“I will make it through.”
The wave of Nane’s sermon bounced off the distorted shape towards Sirone.
Although it was a straight attack, it was probably the most powerful blow in the world, and it penetrated between Sirone’s eyebrows in an instant.
‘stop.’
Seongeum’s eyes trembled in shock as the waves flew in with the momentum to pierce Sirone and froze in space.
“Time stopped.”
It was a magic called stop.
‘It has already overtaken me.’
If there is an etheric wave in the space series of scale magic, the vertex of the time series will be called a stop.
“Did you understand that?”
Nane was the only person who could remain calm in front of the finest magic.
“Then what will you answer this question?”
The coldest concept on Nane’s left side, and the hottest concept on the right side, turned into dozens of swords and sprang out.
“Sermon contradiction.”
The sand in the desert froze as the sword passed, and flames soared on the other side.
“origin.”
As the light of Yahweh, which contained all the information in the universe, expanded along the Spirit Zone, a small sphere of light appeared in both hands.
Mental realization – spherical sphere.
Sirone, who senses supercognition, controls all phenomena like matter, and the concept is expressed through the sphere, the basic form of the universe.
“Turn from the beginning of causality.”
As the two spheres of Yahweh merged and rotated at tremendous speed, the concept of Taegeuk rotated the world.
“Great!”
As the heat and cold mixed together, it seemed that a terrible event that violated the rules of the universe occurred, and it was immediately released into nothingness.
Kido’s mouth gaped blankly.
“What kind of fight is that?”
The reason no one can answer the question is because it is a clash of concepts that transcend phenomena.
Nane also had no choice but to admit that Kar’s state of convergence to the limit of 0 was equal to his own.
The sword engraved on Nane’s tongue lost its light.
“… … I can’t seem to get it through here.”
It seemed like it would be a long fight.

[737] To the stars (1)
you said
“Sirone, as long as you deny me, I cannot become a god, but neither can you.”
It meant that neither Sirone nor Nane could liberate this world from suffering.
“From now on, the world will face terrible suffering. I will end this fight as soon as possible.”
Sirone thought he could handle it.
“Even if life ends in vain, as long as we love something, I will never give up.”
Nane’s fingertips pointed at Sirone.
“Then you are the one who suffers the most.”
perhaps.
“Great purifier. The sins we have created will come true and overwhelm you. It is too much work to do alone.”
Nane’s body melted away like smoke.
“I hope the nightmare isn’t too long.”
In the place where Nane disappeared, a desert sandstorm blew up and erased any trace of him.
“A nightmare?”
I balanced the two extremes of the law, but it was me who was on the free side.
‘It’s a losing battle no matter what.’
This is because Nane, who defined the world as a ball, can commit any terrible thing, while Sirone must protect them all.
“You are not alone, Sirone.”
Lian came over and put his hand on Sirone’s shoulder.
“Even if everyone in the world turns away from you, I will follow you.”
I don’t know how far away the fight will be, but at the end of the day, Lian would be by my side.
“I agree too.”
As Seongeum approached Sirone and stretched out his arm, Lian’s large straight sword jumped through the space and was caught in his hand.
Throwing it at Lian, she said.
“In the future, humanity must face a great enemy. As the princess of the Jincheon Empire, it was something she could not ignore. I will return to her hometown and give her words to her father.”
If it were the emperor of the Jincheon Empire, even the voice could not be moved, but Mungyeong silently followed her.
“Go to the ivory tower. Since you put our lives on hold, I think we deserve it.”
“The ivory tower.”
To begin with, no candidate was obsessed with becoming an ivory tower star, but now things have changed.
‘If we don’t all fight together, we can’t win.’
Even Sirone, who reached the unprecedented level of being an infinite wizard, could not completely block Nane’s great work.
Unless there is a winner on either side, it is obvious that numerous sacrifices will follow.
“I’m going to the ivory tower.”
Voice nodded.
“Good idea. I will take you.”
If it was an etheric wave, it would be able to go directly to the Ivory Tower regardless of the distance.
Kido said.
“I’m not going to the ivory tower.”
Seeing Kido’s eyes, Sirone had already expected it.
“You’re thinking of leaving, Kido.”
“I want to find out what I realized. I’m so confused right now. Do you understand, Sirone?”
Just the journey from knowing to mind and from mind back to knowing takes time.
“of course. Because it is your life.”
Lian, who was lost in thought while listening to Kido’s words, said as he inserted the great sword into his back.
“Sirone, I’m not going to the Ivory Tower either.”
This time, Sirone nodded.
“I knew it would be you.”
“I want to go home and organize my thoughts. I should do what I can.”
Although he defeated Ymir, he was only a molar. In order to protect Sirone in the final war, he must become stronger.
“Sirone, you will become a star in the ivory tower.”
Maybe because she was the only one in this world who opened her senses, Lian was able to leave her side for a while.
“Then I should be a knight worthy of you. I always seem to be chasing after you, but give me time this time too.”
Mungyeong looked at Rian’s back and thought.
‘Do you think there is still room to go up?’
The power of Lian, who smashed Ymir’s torso, was not at a level that even Jincheon’s swordsman could catch up with.
“okay. I’ll be waiting for you.”
Rian and Kido are dependable colleagues, but in order to prevent Nane from doing a great job, they had to endure longing.
‘Because the world will change faster than ever.’
said the voice.
“Let’s leave when we’re done talking. Because I think I have to go back to the Jincheon Empire as soon as possible.”
Kido stepped back from Seongeum’s side and said.
“Sirone, are we friends?”
Kido would travel the world and come to a certain conclusion, and it could have been a denial of Sirone’s conclusion.
“of course. You are my dearest friend. No matter what situation you face, you will never change.”
Only then did Kido, who was relieved, turn around and quickly jumped out toward the desert where the horizon stretched out.
“Good luck, Sirone!”
Sirone kept his eyes on Kido’s back for a long time as he fluttered his old cloak.
“Have a good trip.”
Then he turned to Ryan and asked.
“Are you okay by yourself? How about going together to the village? It would be difficult to find food here.”
Lian stirred up the great sword on his back.
“With this, you can survive in hell. Don’t worry about me and come back as a star.”
The Ivory Tower test felt like she had traveled her entire life, so Sirone also missed home.
‘Amy… … .’
My heart skipped a beat when I thought I’d see you soon.
“I will leave now.”
As Mungyeong bowed her head to Lian with a heart of respect and stood behind the three treasures of Seongeum, an etheric wave spread.
Seongeum, who had pulled the space all the way to the North Pole, cast Chukchi, and the three figures disappeared.
Lian’s eyes, who had been happily watching the place where Sirone disappeared, suddenly burned with fear.
“Ymir.”
An illusion of a giant shimmered over the desert horizon.
* * *
corona kingdom.
The Kingdom of Corona, on the northern limit of human habitation, was the only country in the Arctic.
As a country built on ice caps, ice crafts were developed, and it was almost the only market in the Ivory Tower.
People who live in a country where Blizzard strikes every day feel death closer than life.
People were making faces as cold as ice in the scenery of the city, where even the torches hanging on the walls were at stake.
“Where is here?”
It didn’t seem like an ivory tower, so when Sirone turned her head, Seongeum bit her lip with a puzzled expression.
“Probably Corona Kingdom.”
Corona, the size of a city on the continent, seemed small to Seongeum, who transcended the huge space, as if she had just passed by, but the only place where people lived in the North Pole was the Ivory Tower or Corona anyway.
“I couldn’t get to the Ivory Tower.”
At the same time as I cast Chukji, the feeling of the ivory tower disappeared and I lost my coordinates.
It was here that I arrived at a place where my senses were at least affected by a feeling of some kind of emergency escape.
‘Is there anyone who handles the space?’
It would have been unbelievable in the past, but now that I dealt with Sirone, Nane, and Ymir, my thoughts were different.
‘It’s quite possible to happen.’
It also meant that the knowledge of voice was broadened.
“There’s nothing you can’t do if you try again, but the result will be the same anyway. You wouldn’t be hanging the signboard of the ivory tower without this level of preparation.”
Sirone thought the same.
“huh. But since we’ve come all the way to the North Pole, we’ve shortened the time. I’ll visit you from now on. thank you.”
When Sirone, who had regained her composure, smiled, a blush slowly bloomed on Seongeum’s cheeks.
‘He’s a kind person.’
What Anchal said was not a lie.
‘I don’t want to fight with this person.’
As much as there are many things I want to say, I was not happy with the current situation where I am limited by time.
“How much time can you give me?”
“ha ha ha.”
Sirone burst into laughter at the words, as if the voice compulsion to measure an opponent by distance turned into time.
“I can give you anything. If it wasn’t for you, it would have taken more than 10 days to reach the North Pole.”
“I mean ten days.”
Seongeum shyly smiled and stepped back.
“When you become a star, please stop by Jincheon. I will use the 10 days you gave me then.”
“No, it’s not necessary, if you want… … .”
“You promised. 10 days.”
Now that Sirone knew the nature of the voice, he agreed without adding anything.
“okay. I’ll give you my 10 days.”
It was a satisfactory answer.
“I will also give you my spirit.”
“huh?”
Sirone asked back, but Seong-eum smiled meaningfully and disappeared with Mungyeong.
“… … Seeing the spirit is probably.”
It would mean being friendly without fault.
“Shall we start soon?”
Having come to that conclusion, Sirone walked the streets of Corona Kingdom with a much lighter heart.
It was already late at night, and there was no light on except for the bar, and the aftereffects of fighting for days without a break came belatedly.
‘Something is a little strange.’
At some point, I felt that Armand couldn’t recover from fatigue, but now I couldn’t even reach that point.
“I want to sleep. I want to sleep.”
Giving strength to my self-closing eyelids, I went to an inn where warm steam was rising.
‘I can’t. I should go to sleep.’
Even when they reached the North Pole, they did not know where the Ivory Tower was, and there were no competitors left anyway.
When I opened the door and entered, a middle-aged woman greeted me.
“welcome. This is the White Inn.”
Looking around, I saw a team playing cards at a table in the corner.
Passing through a common scene, Sirone’s eyes fixed on the table in front of the counter.
A red-haired girl of about ten years old was drinking strong alcohol by herself.
‘Do the kids drink here too?’
I thought it might be because it was a cold region, but thinking about it again, it was a nonsensical reasoning.
“Are you here to stay?”
Sirone hurriedly answered the middle-aged woman’s question.
“Ah yes. I would like to have food if possible. I haven’t had dinner yet… … .”
“Oops. There will be leftover bread and soup. But what to do? There are no empty rooms right now.”
“No room?”
Knowing about the kingdom of Corona is fragmentary, but it was not a country that tourists and travelers would often stop by.
“yes. Since yesterday, the residents of the Ivory Tower have been staying as a group, so the room is full.”
‘Ivory Tower residents? But how are you here?’
Sirone narrowed her eyes in surprise and looked back at the four people playing the card game.
There was no conversation at all, just like a machine, drawing cards, putting them down, and collecting stakes.
‘It looks like 4 Iruki are sitting.’
said the middle-aged woman.
“Today, the blizzard is bad. If it doesn’t matter if you join the room, I’ll ask the awake guests about their intentions.”
“Ah, if you would… … .”
“You can use the same room as me.”
After pouring the strong drink into her mouth, the girl looked back at Sirone and raised her mouth, while the middle-aged woman put her chin on her chin and muttered.
“Um, but the union of men and women is a bit… … .”
“How are you? It should be good for both parties. I still missed the man. I won’t be paying for the room.”
Sirone frowned.
“Little boy, I can’t use those words. And drinking already is not good for you.”
“Well, since it was me, it must be tiring.”
“huh? what did you just say?”
When Sirone blinked, the girl who had been looking at the glass with disheveled eyes turned her head.
“Even an infinite wizard goes to the goal if hit properly?”
Sirone immediately opened her senses.
‘I’m not a child.’
As the Ultima System combined with Supercognition, the false information surrounding her disappeared in an instant.
It was a woman with an attractive appearance that seemed to be wearing no makeup, a slender body, and coolly elongated limbs.
“Oh right!”
A middle-aged woman crossed her palms.
“To a normal person, she must have looked like a girl. This is St. Mirac Minerva.”
“castle?”
“I am an ivory tower dweller. Wait, what star did you say it was?”
Minerva spread her five fingers.
“Oh, it was five-star. By the way, how about Miss Minerva? Are you really willing to join us?”
“I said good. The doctor over there is important.”
Sirone didn’t hear anything.
‘If it’s five stars, it’s five stars, right? wait for a sec… … Minerva? The one I saw in the book… … .’
Mirak Minerva.
It was the name of a great witch who was one of the 100 most dangerous people in the world and who had driven the world into despair 700 years ago.

[738] To the stars (2)
* * *
“come in. It’s here.”
Room 12 on the third floor where Minerva stayed was a small room with simple furniture and a single bed.
It was a problem that there was only one bed, but even if it was a couple, it was too big to sleep together.
Sirone saw a long broom, supposedly hers, leaning against the wall.
‘Witch’s broom.’
Minerva’s broom has entered the history books as one of the fastest objects in the world.
Minerva asked, taking off her top.
“Which play do you like? I don’t really like it. If you tell me, I’ll make it right.”
“I told you before I came in, but I didn’t follow Minerva because of that.”
Minerva raised her head and smiled.
“Who would believe that? So, what are men? If you’ve followed me this far, don’t you honestly have an idea?”
The lines between the men and women seemed to have changed, but Sirone didn’t care.
“I was so tired that I would have followed him wherever I could sleep. And you promised that Mr. Minerva would take you to her ivory tower.”
Minerva, who took off all her outerwear, looked back at Sirone in front of her folded nightgown.
“So you kept your promise. Because this is the ivory tower.”
Sirone’s eyes widened.
“Is this the ivory tower?”
“To be precise, it would be the terrace of the ivory tower? The kingdom of Corona was founded by the inhabitants of the Ivory Tower. Residents can’t leave the ivory tower for the rest of their lives, so they need a space with all sorts of amenities. It is also easy to entertain guests.”
“Then where is the ivory tower?”
said Minerva, donning a silk gown.
“You can ride the magic circle under the capital. Also, there is no other way to get to the Ivory Tower. In normal cases, that is.”
Because nothing is absolute.
“It is you. A wizard who has reached super senses with a human body will find a way somehow.”
Minerva collapsed on the bed in a coquettish position.
“If you make me happy today, I’ll let you use the magic circle of the royal castle. how is it? It’s a fair deal.”
Sirone looked at her pathetically.
“I’m not used to that gaze. Nice to meet you anyway In the future, let’s do well with the same Five Stars.”
“Oh Dae-seong? me?”
Minerva’s eyes became serious for the first time.
“Maha Garuta has passed away. It’s currently vacant, and I’m back in the ivory tower to honor him. It’s not decided, but Taeseong’s thoughts will be the same as mine.”
The vacancy of Oh Dae-sung will be filled by Sirone.
“Leaving the world means… … .”
“okay. Immortal function was fully opened. You have returned to this world.”
Minerva jumped upright.
“I don’t get it. why did you come back Speaking of this world, eat, buy cheap, fight… … is that all? Honestly I agree with you. If he’s done everything.”
Minerva shrugged.
“It would have been fine. It goes back to before you were born. I know that? You don’t even think you’re alive until you’re born.”
“But we are alive, we are.”
Obsession with everything that exists was the only realization that allowed Sirone to return to this world.
“It is man who defines murder as evil.”
Minerva snorted.
“If I kill most of humanity, he will be the worst killer. But if he kills everyone, it’s not a matter of good or evil. Because it transcends existence.”
Sirone did not waver.
“The reason why even minor creatures can love each other equally is because of the extremely low kar. But after all, you are human too. You’d better think about why Guffin couldn’t fulfill her will and was forced to transcend the photon realm.”
‘Guffins also left.’
As Sirone crouched against the wall, Minerva pounded on the bed and said,
“Don’t do that, come up. I’ll really sleep holding your hand.”
No answer was heard.
* * *
It was probably a nightmare.
Even though Nane was stabbing the colorful sword, Sirone couldn’t even lift a finger.
“You are a minor.”
The pain became despair and ravaged my mind, and I couldn’t open my eyes even if I knew it was a dream.
“Huh!”
The gaze that Karr’s near-perfect existence looked down on was stern enough to freeze his heart.
“You are the lowest in this universe… … .”
The dark sword slowly pierced the pit of the stomach and descended.
“A being of the lowest order.”
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
Light emanated from Sirone’s body, dispelling Nane’s afterimages and a dark space surrounding him.
‘Small world creation… … .’
Realizing that it was Armand’s space, Sirone’s mind finally regained a sense of stability.
“Natural enemies are fearful.”
The sound of sharpening knives was heard from where the small torches were burning.
“Armand… … .”
The body, which had been mixed with all sorts of monsters, was neatly organized and took on the shape of a beautiful woman.
“Without a natural enemy, it does not cycle, and a world that does not cycle is dead.”
The blade, which should have been sharpened from the moment it was born as a demon sword, was now so thin that it was transparent like glass.
“What are you sharpening your knife for?”
“… … Promise me.”
The sword has completely disappeared.
“There will be one chance.”
Armand turned her head and raised the corner of her mouth, her sharp fangs glowing in the torchlight.
“One chance to wield me for all life. Don’t miss it.”
As she raised her hand, fluffy particles of light floated up and flew away.
“Material.”
The moment Sirone wrapped her arms around the light, the darkness disappeared and the huge eyelids opened in the distance and light came in.
“huh?”
I heard the sound of a strong arctic wind, and soon a chill rushed in and made my body tremble.
“Ugh, it’s cold.”
When I woke up and looked, Armand’s robe had disappeared without a trace.
‘It’s not a dream.’
Armand, assimilated with Sirone, changed his function whenever he broke through a certain level.
‘Material.’
When Sirone opened his palm, the light with a heavy mass swelled up like a balloon.
“I see.”
If you can become an infinite wizard and control all information with the light of Yahweh, you don’t have to maintain the shape of a sword.
“for example… … .”
When Sirone came up with an idea, the brilliance of the material disappeared and was reduced to material.
It was a heavy gold nugget that reflected the morning sun.
“Information from a source that transforms into all matter.”
After dropping the gold on the floor like a stone, Sirone realized the material again and made soap, toothpaste, and toothbrush in succession.
“… … Are you sorry about something?”
Much more complex things could be made if supported by engineering knowledge, but for now this was enough.
Indeed, it could be said to be an infinite tool suitable for an infinite wizard, but Sirone savored Armand’s last words.
“I said it was a one-time opportunity.”
And when that opportunity comes, Material will become Armand again and wield the concept of infinity.
“What are you muttering about?”
When Sirone looked up, Minerva was smiling like a cute little girl.
There was no need to confirm her true identity anymore, so Sirone got up from her seat.
“it’s nothing. Are you going to the ivory tower now?”
Minerva watched the harmony of materials right in front of her nose, but seemed to already know without explaining.
“You were very noisy last night. He said he couldn’t sleep at all because he was crying and talking loudly.”
This is why the merger is burdensome.
“sorry. I had nightmares.”
“It seemed so. It was cold last night. Her coat is gone, and no matter how much she shakes it, she doesn’t think it will happen.”
Sirone’s eyes widened.
“Is that really all?”
“Is that so?”
Minerva walked to the door brandishing her broom.
“Wash and come out. I’ll be waiting outside.”
Unlike before, when he quickly left the place, he became even more suspicious, but there was no way to find out anyway.
‘What kind of Five Star is that?’
The reason why she was not afraid even in front of the fearful witch was the proof that Sirone had earned the right to become a star.
When I went down to the first floor, the residents who had played the card game the night before were still playing cards.
Minerva, who had been waiting with a broom that was taller than she was, gestured and pointed outside.
When they arrived at the royal castle along the knee-deep road covered in snow accumulated last night, they were greeted by the lineage of the royal family.
Unlike officials from other countries, he was not afraid of the stars, which gave a glimpse of the relationship between Corona Kingdom and the Ivory Tower.
“It’s been a while, Miss Minerva. You are still beautiful.”
“Ho-ho-ho! For a grandmother who is over 700 years old, that’s a while. The embassy has aged a lot since I haven’t seen him.”
“After about 20 years, a human being is bound to grow old.”
Despite Minerva’s harsh words, the embassy smiled.
“The reason why the one who lives like the wind came back to his hometown is because of the work at the altar, right?”
“yes. I don’t think I can stop you. Perhaps sooner or later this world will come to an end… … .”
Minerva, who suddenly frowned, turned to Sirone and stabbed her in the head with her index finger.
“After all, it is because of this guy. A human being called the Infinite Wizard could not stop the likes of me and came all the way here.”
Sirone was unfair.
“Take a look and tell me. Shouldn’t Minerva be able to stop it herself if she gets angry like that?”
“The kid who said he learned is talking stupid. You couldn’t stop it, so how can I stop it?”
The embassy bowed to Sirone.
“Thank you for saving human life. Humanity is always helped by the Five Stars.”
“I haven’t become a five star yet. and… … We didn’t just fight for humans.”
The embassy, which had been welcoming the stars for decades, understood Sirone’s desire to do exactly that.
“okay. It must have a deep meaning. come follow me Let me guide you.”
While following the embassy, Sirone asked.
“By the way, what is an altar?”
Sirone obtained infinite omnipotence by opening the immortal function, but when it comes to battery, it was all about portraiture.
Because knowledge does not exist by nature.
“It is a gate that erases the boundary between reality and the other side. They’re trying to bring man-made hell into reality. According to the Ivory Tower, 3,600 altars have been built worldwide.”
“3,600… … .”
“If the altar is activated, this world will become hell. The law will lean against me, and after that, eternal extinction.”
“Why are you leaning on me?”
“You’re the only one who thinks that way.”
Because only Sirone denies Nane.
“How many people do you think will find hope in the midst of terrible suffering? you are right The only safe haven for creatures is extinction. You are the one who denies that.”
Minerva’s eyes grew cold.
“Imagine. If you are born with pain, if your throat tears every time you breathe, your eyes burn every time you see something, and your tongue sores every time you speak.”
She stopped walking and looked back at Sirone.
“Are you still going to choose life? Can you wait for your lifespan to end, enduring the pain of every single second of every day?”
Sirone couldn’t be sure.
“I know someone like that.”
I know such a person, but I could never tell him to live like him.
“You mean Gaold?”
“yes. The driving force behind enduring pain is love for Mr. Miro. But in the end it fell into hell. And I… … You’re telling everyone to live like that.”
“It’s enough to know.”
It will be a tough fight.
“If I hadn’t gone to the extreme, you wouldn’t have gone to the opposite extreme. Ordinary people, what, they get their backs bursting in a fight between whales.”
Minerva patted Sirone on the shoulder.
“Anyway, the people who support you will be as few as your kar number in this universe. You have to push up from there.”
the embassy said.
“Im here.”
The magic circle to the Ivory Tower was waiting.

[739] To the stars (3)
* * *
Minerva was not exaggerating when she called the Kingdom of Corona the Terrace of the Ivory Tower.
The size of the 468-story tower was the crystallization of magic, law, and engineering, and it had perfect stealth capabilities that no creature could reach on its own.
Sirone calmly gazed at the scenery outside the elevator until the color of the sky darkened.
Minerva asked in a soft tone.
“Aren’t you surprised?”
It was the first time I saw it with my own eyes, but I felt the whole in the realm of omnipotence, and the emotions that came back were calm.
“I don’t know. Mysterious, but… … .”
“Whoa.”
When Minerva blows air into her ears, Sirone backs away in surprise.
“What are you doing all of a sudden?”
“No, I thought I lost my personality because my Kar was so low. I thought it might be a psychopath.”
Sirone trembled and wiped his ears.
“Can it be? Besides, what does blowing in your ears have to do with a psychopath?”
“okay? I don’t think I could understand.”
The moment he looked into Minerva’s eyes, Sirone felt his heart burn.
‘This… … .’
There is no existence in the world that can pressure Sirone, who has mastered the scale of the universe, with only emotions.
‘It’s not my intention to kill. It’s killing.’
How many lives do you have to end with your own hands to convey this feeling?
Right before she died, the fear pheromone emitted by the creature imbued Minerva with an indelible odor.
“Now you are looking at me.”
She tried countless times from the kingdom of Corona, but she was unable to tense the existence of the super sense.
So now she is 100%.
If the person in this room had been someone other than Sirone, he would have died of shock.
“Why didn’t you accept it?”
For the first time, the smile disappeared from Sirone’s face.
“I don’t want to fight. You won’t understand.”
When Mirac Minerva was in the midst of terrorizing the world, her nickname was Death God.
Also, although not officially recorded, he was the most murderous human in human history.
“okay. You will never understand me.”
Witches have no personality, so there are no taboos.
“For me, the best way to solve a problem is to eliminate it. If the confrontation between Nane and Sirone is a problem, it will end if both of them are killed. No, at least one of them.”
Although it was a simple solution.
“But I couldn’t. If I had a 51% chance of killing you, I would have done it in Corona.”
I didn’t see it until 51 percent.
“The stars are subjective. I don’t want armed conflict, but it happens quite often. There is one last thing I want to confirm before going to Taeseong.”
Minerva’s broom sweeper made a loud noise and shuddered.
“Forgive me.”
The energy of death rising from Minerva’s body rose as if it would explode inside the elevator.
‘death.’
I never counted how many I killed.
Calculated as population per unit area, the number of humans she killed was approximately 42 million.
42 million pheromones that can only be collected from dying creatures hit Sirone directly.
can you forgive
I might vomit blood first and collapse because I can’t accept myself who needs to be forgiven.
“Yahweh.”
Sirone embraced Minerva in a warm light.
“You have arrived.”
The stars who chatted with Taeseong on the last floor of the Ivory Tower heading to the Temple of Earth waited for the lift.
As the elevator, which had covered dozens of floors in an instant, slowly stopped moving in front of them, Tsuoi approached.
“congratulations. I never thought you would become a star.”
Since she had a record of killing Sirone’s spirit in the kingdom of Tormia, it was appropriate for her to greet her as well.
“Huh!”
As soon as the elevator doors opened left and right, the blood drained from Tsuoi’s face.
As the smell of apocalypse leaked out of the elevator, other stars also groaned.
“Is this, Black Death?”
It was the dark magic that Fermi had used in the graduation exam the other day, but it was a different level of intensity.
‘Who the hell did this?’
Sirone and Minerva were standing side by side in the elevator that Louver was looking at.
“Minerva, when are you coming?”
Minerva’s expression did not look good when she stepped out of the elevator first.
As she slowly looked around with cold eyes, no one made eye contact with her.
‘This person is called the death god… … .’
Just smelling her body gave off a tingling fear.
“wait for a sec… … .”
Tsuoi, who had never seen Minerva in person, looked back at Sirone with a surprised expression.
‘You said you rode the lift alone with someone like that?’
Sirone’s expression was also not particularly good, but the fear she felt was nowhere to be found.
While the illusion of the brain watched expressionlessly, the dreamer Louver slowly approached and asked.
“Long time no see, Minerva. But inside the ivory tower, this murderous magic… … .”
“This has been decided.”
After Minerva interrupted Louver’s words, she glanced at Sirone standing behind her and turned around.
“The Human Security Enforcement Department kills me.”
Sirone forgave Minerva.
“Let’s go, Brain.”
The Holy Brain, which could be said to be her direct subordinate, nodded and followed Minerva away.
“What is that… … .”
Tsuoi turned around and muttered, but Sirone approached with a smile.
“It makes me see you again.”
It was already known that Sirone had reached the limitless state through Taeseong’s ability, Gaia.
‘But this… … .’
It feels like a newborn child suddenly became an adult in the blink of an eye.
“Are you really that kid back then?”
Even at that time, Sirone was a promising player that the world was paying attention to, but he fell far short of Tsuoi’s standard.
“Were you the same height back then?”
“Don’t play around! What happened? Does it make sense that I couldn’t stop you after reaching this level?”
It was also the reason Minerva was suspicious.
“Iknow, right.”
Nane’s strength can only be known by those who dealt with it directly, so Sirone couldn’t find a reason to explain it either.
“Welcome, Sirone-kun. Do you remember me?”
Sirone’s eyes narrowed at the sight of Louver, who was a dreamer, but as expected, there was no big emotional fluctuation.
“You were an ivory tower dweller.”
“I work for the Unified Space Management Department. No status among the stars, but you need a leader. I guess I will follow your instructions from now on.”
It is because Mahagaruta of the Unified Space Management Department, which was the existing Five Great Stars, was liberated.
“hello. It’s a Twelve Mini.”
Mini, who was sitting on top of Borbor’s head, stood up and waved her hands.
“It’s a 2-star, and I’m majoring in scale magic.”
Just looking at the size of the mini, it was possible to know the state, but the scale of the person standing in front of it was infinite.
To her, Sirone was a person who had reached the pinnacle of her major, so even though she was the same star, her eyes were full of selfishness.
“You don’t know how much my heart raced when I heard Taeseong-nim talk about it. If you could teach me the secret… … .”
“Time is running out right now.”
When Louver intervened, Minnie immediately shut up.
“Within 48 hours, Nane will liberate all the altars. Before that, let Taeseong receive the title of star.”
“If it’s that urgent, wouldn’t it be better to take care of mine first?”
Even though it was an ivory tower where the world’s best wizards gathered, and even receiving a 5-star title, Sirone was indifferent.
Louver smiled kindly as if he had already expected it.
“Of course, but filling the vacancy in Oh Dae-seong is just as urgent. Tae-seong would think so too. Come follow me.”
Since it was an event of the United Space Management Department, residents in other departments dispersed that way.
Sirone, who was walking side by side with Louver, looked down at the sound he heard from the floor.
“Whoa! Whoa!”
Mini, who had jumped off Borbor, sprinted at full speed and followed Sirone.
“are you okay? It looks tough.”
“Ah, that… … When I release the scale, it gets too big. Do not worry. I run fast.”
Sirone got down on one knee and held out his palm.
“Get on here. let’s go together.”
Louver glared at him, but Minnie couldn’t contain her burning desire.
“Then, take the risk.”
When Mini, who was seated in Sirone’s palm, smiled, Louver shook his head and walked down the street.
“however… … I thought I would be able to choose which department I could work in.”
According to Arte, whom I met earlier, there are five departments in the Ivory Tower, and he chooses a department according to his own philosophy.
“Usually it is. But Oh Dae-seong is an exception. It would be more accurate to say that there is no particular meaning to the department.”
Minnie added.
“The Unified Space Management Department has a role that is closer to command among the departments of the Ivory Tower. It is the role of coordinating opinions with Taeseong on the agendas received from the other four departments.”
“Mr. Mahagaruta also worked in the closest place to Taeseong. You don’t have to either… … .”
Louver, who reached the top of the ivory tower, turned to Sirone and pointed upward.
“You should know at least how to get up there.”
When Sirone raised her head, all she could see was the bluish sky outside the glass ceiling.
“You mean Taeseong is somewhere over there?”
“A place that cannot be accessed without Taeseong’s permission. Only Mr. Mahagaruta was allowed to enter at will. Now you will have to prove your qualifications.”
Since it was the universe, not the sky, even a wizard would not be able to fly through the sky.
‘I can go.’
But even that wasn’t the answer.
‘Anyone can enter means that Taeseong doesn’t have to open the door.’
Sirone put Mini down on the floor and said.
“Then I will go.”
The fact that Yahweh’s light gathers in his hand means that all the information in the world is in the palm of his hand.
“Be open.”
At the end of the short voice, Sirone’s body turned into light and disappeared.
“Wow, this… … .”
Mini opened her eyes wide, and Louver nodded as if guessing something.
“It is different from the Buddha who speaks right. Rather, it seems that everything in the world is willing to give up the truth for him.”
so it’s a miracle
This universe loves Sirone enough to deny the existing law.
“… … How could that be?”
Louver looked up at the sky.
“Perhaps because he gave everything first.”
Earth Temple.
Arriving at Taeseong’s resting place beyond space, Sirone looked around with calm eyes.
A neat-looking woman with stars in her eyes came down the stairs with her pure white clothes flying.
“You’re here, Hexa.”
There was sadness in Sirone’s eyes.
“I’m sorry. Because I couldn’t call you my child.”
All creatures born from the stars must be children of Taeseong, but Sirone was an exception.
“Is there anyone more pitiful than you in this world? But think of this universe as your parent.”
Taeseong’s hand caressing Sirone’s cheek was cold, but it didn’t feel cold.
“So, how does it feel to be a god?”
It must have been a joke to lighten the mood, but Sirone, who experienced Andre’s 19,000 world, couldn’t help but laugh.
“There is something I want to know.”
A look of embarrassment crossed Taesung’s face.
“Am I a user (user)?”
This is the truth beyond infinity.
“Or is it a ghost that only exists in the system?”

“You should have kept pushing! Didn’t you know that the error decreases as the number of trials increases?”

“That needs bullets too! If you followed your strategy, you would have to walk all the way to the house documents!”
“look! That’s right! There is nothing in the world that can be consumed infinitely! Same goes for energy!”
“Why are you saying that all of a sudden!”
“Ahahaha!”
Sirone burst into laughter. Everyone who challenges toward their dreams is one. So success and failure are only secondary issues.
Even if the people of the world point fingers at it as useless, or ridicule it as an idealist who can’t support a family, isn’t mankind able to develop this far because someone is doing it in the end?
‘It’s okay even if it’s not me. I am… … It doesn’t matter if it becomes someone else’s fertilizer.’
Sirone didn’t worry any longer. He is grateful for all the luck that has allowed him to come true, and he just needs to keep moving towards his dreams.
Iruki asked curiously.
“Sirone, why are you splitting things like that? Did you eat anything weird?”
Sirone shook his head without answering. And he made a promise again and again and moved on.
“I’m back, boys.”
* * *
There are two days left before the suspension is lifted.
Nade and Iruki arrived at the 4th training ground early in the morning and were waiting for Sirone.
It was early, but it was summer, so the son-in-law was bright, and the two of them looked at the entrance, yawning.
said Nade, rubbing his sleepy face.
“Ah, what is it? Call me in the morning.”
“Didn’t you say you had something to show me?”
“What are you showing me all of a sudden? I am full of energy just by showing you so far.”
“well. It must have been tattooed on a pepper.”
“Puhahahaha!”
Imagining what Iruki said, Nade burst into laughter. Meanwhile, Sirone entered the training ground.
“Oh, he was already there. But why is Nade like that?”
“I don’t know. I guess it’s because I’m a pervert.”
“Puhahaha! Tattoo! tattoo there… … ! Fuhahaha!”
Anxious Sirone didn’t ask. It’s probably because the two of them were exchanging silly jokes and doing that.
“Anyway, let’s begin. Because I want to show you quickly.”
“What are you showing me? tattoo? Fuhahaha!”
Iruki said as if he was pathetic.
“stop. it’s not funny anymore Anyway, why did you call me here? What do you want to show me?”
“wait. I’ll try right away.”
After walking to the center of the training ground, Sirone held out her hand toward the rocky mountain.
“what? photon output? Did you increase the output?”
Sirone cast a photon cannon. A flash of white light quickly passed in front of Nade and Iruki’s eyes.
bang!
The rock exploded with a dull roar.
Nade and Iruki’s eyes, which had been dull until a moment ago, widened. The chin seemed to come down.
The spot where the light struck was wide and sunken. The two ran and looked for traces without saying who was first.
“What, what? is it magic Or real magic?”
“It’s strange. You’re shocked by the light. I know that photons cannot be fused. Sirone, what happened?”
Sirone said with a proud expression.
“A new weapon I learned this time. It’s not a photon output, it’s a photon cannon.”
“It’s a Photon Cannon. The meaning is plausible. What is the principle?”
“that is… … A bit long, so to speak.”
As Sirone spared his words, Ned came running quickly. And shook Shirone’s shoulder with her face as her sleep fled.
“Tell me quickly! how did you do it! To put physical force into light, this is absolutely impossible!”
Light and electricity are cousins, so Nade was clearly aware of what Sirone had done.
“I will tell you. therefore… … Would you like to go somewhere with me?”
* * *
Sirone and the others entered the restaurant in the noble district. While satisfying her hunger with seafood pasta, Sirone talked about how she mastered the Photon Cannon.
The vortex of dust on the bed, the situation in which Ulk was thrown down the cliff, and the principles of the Photon Cannon that he realized at that moment.
Even without mentioning Armin, the Photon Cannon was an idea unique to Sirone, so it was easy to explain.
Nade and Iruki listened intently, not knowing whether the pasta was going into their mouths or their noses.
After the hour-long explanation, Iruki, who was lost in thought, put down his fork and said,
“I heard about gauge symmetry from my father. The gist is this. Are you saying that there is a separate particle that carries mass? And you can handle that particle.”
Shirone realized anew what a great person Iruki’s father was. To teach his son about gauge symmetry and nothing else. As the head of the dragon, he seemed to be aware of all the cutting-edge theories established throughout the wizarding society.
said Nade.
“In a word, the result of the immortal function is mass. He mastered the Photon Cannon and lost his sense of portrait.”
“huh. Besides, I don’t even have nightmares anymore.”
Iruki and Nade were lost in thought. A particle that transfers mass to matter. Sirone’s realization was a great discovery.
In particular, the Photon Cannon was a magic unique to Sirone. Because no one is omnipotent. If you are not a person who has directly experienced the infinite realm, it is not possible to cast simply by mastering omniscience.
“Awesome, Sirone. This may be even greater than we imagine. If you patent it, it’s a discovery that you can sit on the money cushion right away!”
Numerous inventions that could be made with Sirone’s theory were already popping up in Nade’s mind.
“So I want to ask you something, can you go to the library with me?”
“huh? library?”
“The school library is under disciplinary action, so entry is prohibited. So I’m going to go to the aristocratic library. To research the Photon Cannon a bit more. But since I can’t go in, I want you guys to take me.”
“That doesn’t matter. It will help us too. But why can’t I go in alone?”
Commoners cannot enter the noble library. If the suspension is lifted, you can use the school library, but I realized something after going to the slash-and-burn village. Denying identity doesn’t change anything. At least I wanted to be honest with my friends.
“Actually, I am not an aristocrat.”
Nade, who was chewing on the pasta, opened his mouth blankly. Iruki was also staring at Shirone as if shocked.
“I am a commoner. I was abandoned in a stable when I was young, and now my parents raised me. My father is an ordinary mountaineer.”
Although he jumped into the world of magic late, I can’t imagine he was a commoner. In particular, the fact that she was abandoned by her biological parents did not match the wrinkled appearance of Sirone at all.
“Sorry. I haven’t said it until now. I will accept any criticism. But I didn’t want to lie anymore.”
Nade and Iruki looked at each other. They felt the same feelings for each other through their eyes.
Iruki turned to Shirone and spoke first.
“It is a shocking fact. But to be honest, I don’t feel anything special? Anyway, you are Sirone.”
“So do i. I wouldn’t know if I knew it from the beginning, but now that I’ve heard those words, nothing will change. The times we had together will not disappear.”
I thought my friends would understand, but it was just a personal expectation. When she was recognized by them, Sirone was touched by her heart.
Iruki lowered his head and giggled.
“So it was a special screening. The reason I learned magic late was because I wasn’t a noble. Well, talent isn’t something you’re born with, considering where you’re from. It’s really great.”
“thank you. for saying so.”
Nade waved his hand at Sirone’s thrilled appearance.
“Hey. It can’t be that serious. I think I’m rather fortunate To be friends with you without prejudice. If I had known in advance, I wouldn’t have even dreamed of the research presentation a few days ago.”
Iruki gave up his thoughts and stood up from the table. If he dragged out more time here, the atmosphere would only deteriorate.
“Okay, let’s go to the library. It was boring to play, but it worked. Let’s burn the passion for learning properly!”
Sirone and Nade stood up and shouted.
“Good!”
Return of the Archmage (1)
Basuka, the capital of Tormia Kingdom.
There was a dungeon 70 meters deep underground that was completed 100 years ago in the underground mountain range that flowed around the capital. Called the Labyrinth of Darkness, this place was once the hideout of the great wizard Viltor Arcane, who ruled the world.
Arcane, an authority on dark magic, fought with various nations until he suddenly disappeared 40 years ago due to an incident.
At the time, Arcane’s wizard level was an unofficial level 3.
Once you reach level 3 or higher, you will be given the title of Archmage regardless of public or non-official.
The wizard’s grade is determined by achievements and reputation, and the Magic Association manages this with a special scoring method.
The number of points required to advance from level 10 to level 9 is 1,000 points, including Achievements and Fame. And the number of points needed to go from level 4 to level 3 was 280 million points.
In other words, third-class wizards were those who had accumulated enormous achievements and reputations that ordinary people could not imagine.
Comparing 500 points for the achievement set for clearing the demon cave with a risk level of A grade and 100 points for the reputation set for meeting the king at the invitation of the royal castle, it was possible to guess how much Arcane was stirring the world.
Arcane rose to the position of an unofficial third-class wizard 40 years ago, at the age of 89. Looking at the score at the time, the part about his achievements was 100 million points, and the part about fame was 180 million points.
The reason his reputation is higher than his achievements is because he was a troublemaker who turned the continent upside down.
Banned experiments are the basics, and the bane of the era when the national foundation was shaken by accidents such as producing anarchists by association with dark organizations.
Elderly people over the age of 70 would shudder at the mere mention of Arcane’s name, so it was clear how high his notoriety was without even mentioning the 280 million points.
“Pooh. Pooh.”
Arcane opened her eyes in a crystal tube filled with green liquid. He was not wearing a single thread, and his skin was stretched like a 149-year-old body.
‘at las… … It’s finally completed, the essence of darkness.’
It was the dark power he had accumulated over 40 years. Arcane intended to absorb this and recreate its former glory.
The reason humans die as they age is because cells reach the limit of self-replication. However, Arcane was suppressing cell division through a bio-maintenance device.
Arcane glanced around and saw the crystal on the desk. At first, it was something that was shiny like a diamond, but now it has turned black. It was thanks to the accumulation of dark power in the crystal with injection magic once a day.
‘Alpheas, wait! I will definitely repay this disgrace.’
After being mortally wounded by Alpheas in his early 20s, Arcane’s magical power declined rapidly.
However, he survived with a single thought of revenge, and finally, today, he would regain his former power and become a great wizard once again.
As the green liquid from the life support system drained down the drain, Arcane’s back bent as the water level dropped. It was a senile body that could be put in a coffin right away.
As the front of the crystal ball was cut open, Arcane gasped for breath and crawled out.
“Canis! scale! Do you have anything!”
A young-looking boy and girl opened the door and entered. The atmosphere was somewhat gloomy, probably because he had learned dark magic.
“Did you call, Master?”
“clothes. Give me my clothes.”

[740] To the stars (4)
A long silence passed behind Sirone’s question, putting the name of the Earth Temple to shame.
“Sirone.”
Taeseong opened his heavy mouth.
“Human beings have the ability to give names to things that exist. In other words, intelligence.”
Naming is what intelligence is all about.
“But just because you have the ability to know something doesn’t mean you can know everything.”
Although numerous scholars explore the end of the universe.
“If you think that one day you will know everything, it is only the limit of human beings who have not yet realized the nature of intelligence.”
Because the answer lies beyond infinity.
“That’s why even I, who know everything in the world, can’t say for sure what is outside the universe.”
“But I am here.”
It wasn’t an outside issue.
“You can tell me what you see beyond the veil of infinity you see here and now.”
“I really don’t know. There is no reason for me to lie to Sirone.”
“Can’t you at least guess?”
“It’s something you can’t guess.”
Taeseong was adamant.
“If you put your feet on the ground and look up at the sky, you can make a lot of guesses. You are free to let your imagination run wild. But at the end of the world, you can’t. Sirone-kun knows that it is too dangerous.”
It is unbelievable to guess the nature of the world.
“Beyond the veil may only be nothing. This may be the beginning. Why are you denying yourself?”
“I don’t deny it, I want to admit it. I heard that Mr. Mahagarutha attained liberation. And never came back.”
Had Mahagartha awakened from his dream by now, or would he have perished in eternal nothingness?
“I was able to come back to this world because I gave up everything in the realm of infinity… … .”
The reason Sirone was sad was this.
“If I had crossed the border, I wouldn’t have come back either.”
You can’t return to a dream outside of a dream, so I knew that Nane was right.
“If I want to defend this world against Nane, no, if I want to surpass him, I think we have to define Hexa first.”
Taeseong let out a long sigh.
“Infinity is… … .”
Then he looked back at Sirone and asked.
“What is it? cowardice? What about humans? what about the stars? Everything is just a name given to something that exists for no reason. It just exists, and we define it according to our needs. That is why infinity and cowardice are only names given to us.”
Taeseong’s index finger aimed at Sirone’s forehead.
“Even God.”
“… … .”
“For humans, the concept of God has no reason to be complicated. Because it’s a realm of faith, and it’s a name built for that purpose from the beginning. However, when the person who enters the realm of the gods becomes Sirone, who is called the infinite wizard… … .”
Taeseong lowered his arm.
“You run into all sorts of contradictions. You can handle all the information in the world. God. But the problem is, that information is from the human point of view.”
Sirone was clearly a god, but he was a god that humans could define.
“I know why Sirone-kun asked the question. Ideas realized through the 8th sense simply exist, so they do not need to exist or not exist… … .”
That’s why he controls the phenomena of all things freely.
“It is also just an infinity named by humans, so the true meaning is that it is outside.”
Taeseong immediately spoke.
“Also, since the hexa is made of light, that is, to translate it differently… … That it is just an abnormal signal flowing through the system, not a specific entity.”
I felt like my heart stopped when I heard Taeseong.
“Eventually I… … .”
Taehyung’s expression softened.
“This is my home.”
“home… … What?”
“is it so. Let’s try it. What Sirone-kun wants to know. I will guess beyond infinity at the end of the world.”
I could feel Taesung’s kind heart.
“As Sirone-kun knows, I am the reincarnation of a star. My name, who governs all the stars, is Gaia. for example… … Let’s say I’m actually a program. The Gaia Program.”
Taeseong emphasized the feeling of being a family.
“The universe is born and the natural world is born in it. There are two huge programs that make up the natural world. One is me, Gaia who governs the planets. And another… … .”
Taeseong’s gaze turned to the ceiling.
“This is the stellar program, Ra.”
It was another name for the sun.
“The Gaia program builds a new system through the energies delivered by the stellar program. It is the birth of the sub-system of the natural world, the biological system.”
“And in that biome… … .”
“It is still too early to speak of humans.”
Taeseong stopped talking.
“When Gaia creates the environment with the power of Ra, the biological program Argones spreads the cell. The number of evolutionary species is infinite, but the substance is the simplest information carrier.”
Sirone’s eyes widened.
“Argones?”
Fisho, who majored in insect magic in the graduation exam, was the name of the alien creature that became its host.
“Ra’s power, Gaia’s environment, Argones’ cell. Combining these three elements indefinitely, there must be a certain space in this wide universe where creatures can live. Then, the basic preparations are completed.”
“Preparation for what?”
“Ready for users to use this world.”
Sirone shut his mouth.
“I am speaking on the assumption that Sirone’s guess is true. Even if a creature exists, constructing a mind is another matter. First of all, it has to be real, and yet it has to offset the fear of death.”
“It is God.”
“yes. Mind Program God. Humans call it this way because it is a program derived from the star, the source of life.”
Taeseong raised his index finger.
“Eternal and immortal Ra.”
It was Anchera.
“Nevertheless, Anchera may not know that he is a program. Perhaps you only know it as a being who suddenly opened your eyes in the realm of nothingness. He subjectively defines all concepts, stores them in the Akashic Records, and transmits them to all living things in the universe through quantum transmission. That’s why Nane said that this world is Ankera’s dream.”
Everything that I felt as a portrait became clearer as if I could see it with my eyes.
“But an unexpected problem arose.”
Taehyung’s eyes softened.
“The mind program was activated, and all users were to achieve eternal life through reincarnation. However, the first humans who came out of Gaia, that is, the Gaians, began to resist the God program.”
Sirone recalled the Gaian record he had seen at Babel.
“So you were trying to get away from Anchera.”
“yes. It was a fierce war. Every time Ankera tried to reset to catch the error, Gaia desperately blocked it. They considered their enlightenment to be more important than the universe. It had to be passed on to posterity somehow.”
Sirone swallowed his saliva.
“Ankerado attacked them with all the concepts he had defined. He seemed unable to stop the reset, with the tide turning. In the meantime, someone from Gaia found a way not to lose his enlightenment.”
“That way… … .”
“You go outside and inject your own code. It’s about infiltrating a special signal that can withstand a reset.”
Sirone shook her head.
“How could that be? Even Mahagaruta-san can’t influence this world since he’s already been liberated.”
“There is one way.”
Sirone’s eyes widened as he suddenly realized.
“no way… … .”
“yes. Guffin expunge.”
Taeseong waved his fingers.
“As soon as it is reset, it leaves the photon field and injects a new signal. This is the truth behind the original reset.”
Sirone bit her molars.
“Then what is Hexa… … .”
“Mind programs transmit information through quanta, biological programs transmit information through electricity, but ultimately it is a network based on photons. Time, matter, and energy are all light. And the Gaians use that unit of information… … .”
Taesung spat out in a cautious voice.
“It was called Hexa.”
At the same time, tears flowed down Sirone’s cheeks.
“Even the concept of cause and effect is nothing more than a definition freely interpreted by Ankera’s dream. There is no cause for Hexa who came from outside this world. That’s why he is free from Ankera’s reset, and is the only one who lives outside of his dreams.”
“Huh. Whoops.”
Taeseong’s heart collapsed at Sirone’s cry, but he had to come to a conclusion since he had come this far.
“The light that makes up Hexa imitates human information as it is. That’s why Shirone-kun is also human. However, when viewed from the outside, as Sirone-kun guessed… … .”
Taehyung bit his lip for a moment.
“Maybe it’s just a signal.”
Shirone’s shoulders shook as she lowered her head.
“I am… … I am… … .”
My parents who raised me, my beloved Amy, my friends at magic school, and countless people I have met over the course of my 20 years of life.
‘None of them… … .’
Not connected.
It’s just a program of some pioneers to get out of Ankera’s control.
“But maybe not.”
At Taesung’s words, Sirone raised her head again.
“I made it clear, Sirone. It’s just a guess. I also don’t know the truth. It’s just that Sirone-kun’s realization from cowardice was grafted onto the point of view of infinity. If you put your mind to it, you can come up with any other story. The biggest problem is that the Guffins have already been expunged.”
“Why does that matter?”
“I know all the history of the universe, but I can’t remember the Guffin. The most curious part is why did the Gaians compose Hexa with human information?”
Sirone’s eyes blinked.
“Even if this world is at any point in the cowardice, there is quite a bit of evidence that humans can’t be concluded as the only users. The same goes for the Terraforce race and the Gaians. It’s clear that the model is much more complex than Sirone guesses. But surprisingly, what Gaia chose was human.”
“Hmm.”
Sirone, who finally came to his senses, stroked his chin.
“I became an infinite wizard by opening my 8th sense, but Gaia people are a race that opened their 11th sense and intimacy. She is on a different level from Sirone, who uses omnipotence by human standards. Therefore, the universe they analyzed and the assumptions outside the curtain may be completely different from what Sirone thinks now.”
“Beyond infinity.”
It was a one-line phrase that Guffin gave to Sirone after Gaiain’s record ended and the screen was reset.
“… … come to me.”
Taeseong grabbed Sirone’s trembling shoulders.
“Maybe it’s not a signal, Sirone.”
Although the guffin was expunged.
“I might not be alone.”
“Alone… … no… … .”
Tears, much hotter than before, flowed profusely.
“Go beyond me and reach the ultimate. And meet me proudly at the end of this world. your real parents.”
Sirone always nodded.
“yes. certainly… … .”
At least not yet was the time to give up everything.
“great. then.”
Taeseong, who tapped Sirone on the shoulder, said with a pleasant smile.
“From now on, we will begin the bestowal ceremony for the stars.”

[741] Great Purifier (1)
Star Award Ceremony.
Unlike the residents who stay in the ivory tower for the rest of their lives, those who directly go out to the world and spread the teachings are called stars.
Their authority was not received from someone, but was carried out by themselves, so no grandiose procedures are needed.
However, being recognized for the value of intellect by an incarnation of a star must have been an unfamiliar feeling for anyone born on this land.
“Sirone, I award you the highest five stars. Please become Five Stars and protect this land.”
Taeseong’s voice was heard softly, and the castle and pavilion appeared in front of him.
“this… … .”
This planet’s high pass that can only be possessed by those who have received the title of Star.
“Take it. As the owner of this land, it is a heavy burden that I entrust to you.”
‘Lord of this land… … .’
There are many kings and nobles with territories in the world, but they were not the true masters either.
“This tile represents me. All who dwell on this land are my children, and I will gladly help you.”
What those in power fear is the power of the ivory tower, but at least I liked the meaning.
“yes. thank you.”
The castle plate with the five stars engraved on it was made of a mixture of iron and wood, and it was a touch that Sirone had never touched before.
“It was made of star fragments. You should be able to see significant effects just by carrying it on your body.”
“It’s a fragment of a star… … .”
If you knew the principle, you should be able to summon it with material.
“What effect does it have?”
“I heard that it promotes blood circulation and is good for stamina.”
Sirone hung the holy orb around her neck.
“Are you done now?”
“Usually it is. However, Sirone-kun is the Five Stars that lead the stars, so there are things you need to know. Of course, there are also perks.”
‘It’s a privilege.’
The king of a country wondered what else he could give besides power.
“First of all, most stars have moons nearby. I can help you if you want. How about Sirone-kun?”
“Um, a satellite… … .”
The first thing I thought of was Lian, and then several people passed through my mind.
“I don’t think it’s really necessary.”
Taeseong nodded as if he knew that.
“okay. In fact, no one has a satellite in Odaeseong. It’s unusual to see it as a coincidence.”
The satellite must have the direction of orbiting the star as well as the complementarity of assisting and orbiting around the star.
“Each star has a firm philosophy. That’s why I don’t pick satellites only with my skills. Especially if it’s Ohdaesung… … .”
“yes. What I am trying to do is not something that can be obtained by compromising with someone.”
It is a task that must be carried through to the end despite numerous opposition from the top of the intellect.
The star of the ivory tower was such a world.
“That’s why stars who haven’t pulled out satellites sometimes ask for things like weapons or means of transportation. In some cases, they ask us to find a satellite even if we search the outer world.”
“It’s an alien… … .”
Arte’s satellite Tokay came to mind.
“So why don’t you ask Sirone-kun something from me? We can tailor anything you want.”
Even the spiritual world, the source of the object, is under the control of the 4-star resident Louver, so it wasn’t an exaggeration.
“I do not know. It is necessary… … .”
Now that I can use materials, there was no way I could have something I absolutely wanted.
“There is not enough explanation. The type doesn’t matter. Registering it in the ivory tower is important.”
After escaping from her thoughts, Sirone lifted her head.
“Registration?”
“As you know, a star can register another existence besides itself in the ivory tower. Usually it is a satellite, but the same is true for objects.”
Taeseong showed the cards carried by the satellites.
“Having the star plaque means receiving the absolute support of the people of the Ivory Tower. For example, let’s say you register a dagger that anyone can use as a star item.”
The hand turned into a dagger, and a mark orbiting around a star was engraved on the handle.
“If the owner loses the dagger, and someone picks it up and kills the man. And if the murderer were to be punished by the kingdom… … .”
The mark engraved on the dagger emitted an intense light.
“The inhabitants of the Ivory Tower will do everything in their power to wipe the kingdom off the map.”
Sirone swallowed his saliva.
“Ivory Tower residents have absolute trust in the stars. It is to believe that even if a person dies from a lost knife, there will be some inevitable reason that the criminals do not know.”
That is why no one can become a star.
“Nothing is completely wrong or completely right. It is always us who define it. Sometimes compromise isn’t everything. There are times when there is no other way than to make it happen.”
If I had tried to solve all problems through compromise, humanity would have already perished before me.
“Registering the title of a star is the minimum problem-solving ability an ivory tower can have. In other words… … .”
Taeseong held out the handle of the dagger.
“Even if they are wrong, the judgment of the stars is always right.”
“ah… … .”
As Sirone grabbed the handle, the dagger turned a bluish light and flew into beautiful fragments.
“Choose carefully. It doesn’t matter if it’s a person, an object or an animal. Besides sirone, there is only one thing that can be registered in the ivory tower.”
“Yes, I will keep that in mind.”
Thinking that the meaning was conveyed properly, Taeseong smiled with satisfaction and put his palms together.
“This is the basic rights of a star. And Oh Dae-seong is given a special gift.”
“If you give, I will be grateful.”
I don’t really have any material desires, but since I’ve become a great star, shouldn’t I receive what I deserve?
“What kind of gift is this?”
Taeseong asked this question in a playful way, but it was a difficult question to answer when I remembered it.
“Haha, well? Is it like a souvenir?”
I thought it would suit Oh Dae-seong, but Tae-seong shook his head and pointed to the sky.
“I’ll give it one star.”
“… … yes. yes?”
Sirone doubted his ears.
“What are you giving me?”
“Actually, all I have is a star. Everything else was done by the Ivory Tower people.”
Other than that, I couldn’t even guess what it meant to have a star.
“If you have a star… … Will it really be mine?”
“of course. Because I control all the stars in this world, and I am giving you one of them.”
As Taeseong swung both hands around, the glass on the outer wall of the Temple of Earth shone brightly, reflecting the scene of the universe.
“wow… … .”
This time, Sirone was also a little impressed.
“Byul, especially Oh Dae-sung, is a job with a lot to think about in terms of being the leader of the star. Sometimes I think I need a space to think alone, away from the human world.”
“No, but I don’t dare to go to another planet… … .”
“A star without a name is lonely.”
Sirone shut his mouth.
“The universe is surprisingly empty. Not all stars serve their purpose. There are countless stars that exist just to fill the odds. I started because I thought that if even one person could name a star, that would be good too.”
It was an idea that could be done because he was an incarnation of a star.
“okay. I will be grateful.”
He said it was a privilege, but instead Taeseong clapped his hands excitedly and showed the candidates for the stars.
“great! Then I’ll pick out a few stars that people can live on. Pick a star you like and name it.”
Numerous stars spread across the ceiling of the Temple of Earth rushed at the speed of light, and suddenly illuminated a huge planet.
‘pretty.’
It was all blue water, and tens of thousands of islands were spread out in that vast sea.
“The average temperature is 28 degrees. It is a planet similar to the tropical climate of this planet. There are many islands, so it is perfect for a vacation spot. There is no one to name, but there are many different animals and plants spread evenly across the island, so it’s good to take a walk depending on your mood.”
Taesung proudly introduced a masterpiece that came out of the infinite probability of the universe.
“awesome.”
“It is a work that I highly recommend. And next is the star of the blue earth.”
A planet with endless vegetation on a huge continent rotated with blue clouds floating around.
“There are many animals living here. They don’t eat each other because they don’t run out of food. Everyone is gentle. If you like animals, I would recommend this planet.”
As Taeseong pulled the planet closer, mermaids were sitting on rocks in a small lake and singing a beautiful song.
‘Amy will like it.’
While Sirone watched happily, Taeseong introduced the last planet.
“This is definitely a work of art created by the natural world.”
Even on the planet Sirone lives on, it was an endless planet with numerous superb views that were extremely rare to find.
“It is by far the best among those created by volcanoes, typhoons, tides, and tectonic shifts. It’s safe to take your friends with you now. of course… … Although I could sprain my foot while climbing the mountain.”
Mountain peaks rose jagged above the clouds, and the blue sea spread out below the sheer cliffs.
A jungle was formed along a huge river, and animals were moving in herds over the endless fields.
“Um… … okay.”
Sirone withdrew the thoughts that came to his mind after hearing Taeseong’s words for the first time.
‘There was something I wanted.’
I really wanted to have it.
Even if it was made of materials, it was questionable whether it would be possible to create such beauty, let alone time.
“It is not an expression suitable for a star, but it is also rich in resources. There are many materials that are not here. Bringing them in in large quantities is not permitted as it destroys the balance of the stars, but it doesn’t matter if you collect them for personal use. If you can afford it, it would be nice to learn alchemy.”
After completing the introduction of Byul, Taeseong looked back at Sirone.
“If you don’t like something… … .”
“I’ll do it for you.”
When Sirone raised his hand and pointed at the ceiling, Taeseong smiled and nodded.
“Then, please give me a name.”
“The name of the planet… … .”
Sirone’s eyes became wet for a moment.
“Hexa.”
May it not be a lonely name anymore.
“That’s a great name. So from now on, Planet Hexa belongs to Syrone. This is guaranteed by me, who controls the stars in the universe, and no one can claim ownership.”
Taeseong checked the time.
“There is a little more than a day until the altar opens. During that time, we fought fiercely. You can do whatever you want to do.”
Sirone became impatient because it seemed to mean that she should organize her life, which was not long.
“no. I’d rather go back to you. This time, I will make a decision.”
Taeseong shook his head.
“If Sirone loses, no one can stop me. wait for the time It takes time.”
“So you’re saying we’re just going to stand here and watch as the world descends into destruction?”
“It will not perish.”
Taeseong said confidently.
“Sirone, humans are weak, but not weak. Those who have overcome numerous crises so far will not give up the world easily.”
After Taeseong said that, he looked down at the ground, and Sirone also turned his gaze to the blue planet beyond the glass floor.
‘What’s going on?’

[742] Great Purifier (2)
* * *
The planet Taeseong and Sirone look down on is largely divided into five continents.
First of all, the North Pole with the ivory tower.
And below that lies the continent to which more than half of the world’s 70 countries belong.
The continent is divided into North, Central, South, and Middle East.
There are 21 kingdoms in the central continent, which has the highest national density, including Sirone’s hometown, the kingdom of Tormia.
The southern continent has a relatively larger territory than the central continent, but there is a feeling that national power is lower than that of the central continent.
However, the kingdom of Iron, located at the southernmost tip of the continent, was one of the Seven Stars and was a powerful nation representing the south.
Paras, the only kingdom in the Middle East, is also one of the Seven Planets and occupies the Akkadian Desert divided and occupied with Kashan.
When you cross the sea from the Middle East, the second largest land mass in the world comes out, which is called the East.
In the north of the east, there is the Jincheon Empire, a kingdom of three emperors, and six kingdoms under it are fiercely fighting for the second person.
If you cross the equator past the island country under the east, you will find the south, which is also the hometown of Gangnan.
There are 14 kingdoms, but the dominance is weak, and instead thousands of tribes live by keeping their own traditions.
Finally, there is Antarctica, the coldest place in the world, an unknown continent where no living thing can live.
And now.
The great work that had been progressing step by step since Ankera opened the door of the great purification was approaching the final moment.
The 3,600 altars installed in 69 countries around the world, excluding the Arctic kingdom of Corona, are about to open.
* * *
iron kingdom.
Iron Kingdom, one of the seven kingdoms, was a country with painful memories of Marsha’s parrot mercenary group degenerating into bandits.
But that is now a thing of the past.
After rescuing Sirone from the Undercode, Marsha activated a contract with Uorin, and now as a full-fledged S-class mercenary, she was receiving special treatment in the Iron Kingdom.
“What the hell are you doing?”
Freeman, who was looking down at the altar from the bottom of the cliff, rested his chin in thought.
Although he was no longer number two in terms of skill, he was still the vice-captain by Marsha’s side.
A medium-sized, nimble man reported.
“According to our research, more than 1,000 altars have been found all over the world, and there are more than 200 in the Iron Kingdom alone.”
And it has just been completed.
“Is it possible?”
It is impossible to build large altars simultaneously, even for the kingdom project, which would take well over a year.
Civil engineering works that completely cut down a mountain and made it flat were not possible with manpower.
“The power of magic… … Wouldn’t it?”
It was the answer that came closest to the correct answer, but Freeman could not readily accept it.
“Maybe God can do it.”
As the pale faces with no more eyebrows were distorted, the members grabbed their weapons with nervous expressions.
“Shall we infiltrate?”
Marsha ordered it directly, so even if God stayed there, I would have to go.
“Go in.”
As soon as Freeman gave instructions, the members lowered their posture like wild animals and charged toward the cliff.
“stop.”
The voices were small, but the footsteps of the 20 members who possessed superhuman senses stopped without any error.
“leader.”
Clay Marsha, the leader of the Parrot Mercenary Corps, walked through the forest holding a pipe in his mouth.
“What happened all of a sudden?”
Freeman asked, but Marsha only narrowed her eyes and looked down at the altar at the bottom of the cliff.
“It was short-lived. It’s not something we have.”
Horrible rumors from the high society were driving the Iron Kingdom into an end-of-the-century atmosphere, but the value of the mercenaries was money.
the agent asked.
“Captain, what do you mean by that? What in the world is there that we can’t hold?”
It was unusual for Marsha, a brilliant calculator, to withdraw from her plan midway through.
“Urgent information has arrived. The special forces of the Iron Kingdom, which were investigating altars in other regions, were wiped out.”
“Annihilation?”
Unless it was a war with another country, it was extremely rare for Iron’s troops to be wiped out within their own country.
“Who the hell… … .”
Just as Freeman was about to speak, Marsha frowned and pointed at the bottom of the cliff.
On the paved road, a stooped old man was walking toward the altar with a cane on his back.
When Freeman, who had been watching closely, looked back at Marsha, she was gulping saliva through the nape of her white neck.
“Withdraw now.”
“what’s the matter?”
“I don’t have time to explain. That’s not human.”
“If not human, then what?”
“I don’t know either.”
It was an honest impression.
When she encountered Miro’s skills in Under Coder, Marsha thought that humans could not go deeper than this.
‘But that… … .’
surpass the maze
The reason I can be sure is because I felt as if all the scenery in the world was being drawn to the skinny old man.
‘No matter how huge the maze is… … .’
It won’t be heavier than the old man.
“An uninvited guest has arrived.”
Number 1 in the Order of the Ten Commandments, Veron.
When Amitabha Banya’s shiny eyes turned toward the cliff, the members finally realized.
‘Die.’
There was no lie in Marsha’s words.
“Bounce!”
In an instant, the entire mercenary group of parrots disappeared on the cliff, and Veron clicked his tongue.
“Young people these days have no ambition.”
Veron’s staff struck the ground again.
“How long are you going to eat the old man’s back?”
Arriving at the altar, Veron sat down on the lowest floor and fanned with his hand.
“Come to think of it, you’ve lived a really long time.”
The leaders of the Council of Ten Lords all lived more than 10,000 years, but no one knew how long Veron lived.
‘Why can’t I go anywhere?’
What remains in this world?
Just as Veron was silent and thoughtful, a red light rose like a flame in front of his eyes.
“President.”
The 7th rank of the Order of the Ten Commandments, the disciple Prajna Shura, appeared.
He had a body as smooth as a snake, and when he dealt with lies, his dark eyes became long and cold.
“The altar is ready to be opened.”
“… … .”
“I built the altar according to Ankera’s instructions, but there is a lot of talk even in the Eternal Society.”
In order to become a god named Anke, Nane accepted each other in order to save sentient beings.
“What we wanted was for Ra to become a god and this world to become the only one. But now… … .”
A great void is coming.
“Some people are liberated, some people are reincarnated, and now some people are trying to shut it down.”
For Veron, this world was everything.
“As always, we must find meaning. For the Eternal, the meaning of life is the same as that of a mortal.”
“If you come, what is the meaning of Nane’s gong?”
“… … no.”
Veron stood up with his cane.
“So I’m thinking of making it from now on.”
Veron stepped on the steps of the altar and asked Shura who followed him.
“What do you think of fate?”
“The illusion created by the harmony of time… … How much? Because there is nothing outside the law of causality.”
Baron nodded.
“The human mind is just a grain of sand that gets carried away by the flow of time. The flow of the seawater does not change just because the fish are flowing backwards.”
Shura listened.
“If you sow seeds in the present, they will sprout in the future. Humans mistake it for a great ability, but… … .”
Veron caught his breath halfway up the altar.
“In fact, it was already decided from the moment the seeds were sown. it’s not about changing That’s how it goes.”
We do not create the future, but the future that has already been created strikes us.
“If human free will had the ability to truly change things… … .”
With the peak in front of him, Veron turned his head.
“Shouldn’t we be able to destroy the future, away from the illusion of changing the future?”
Even if you sow the seeds, you must be able to sprout.
“That it truly lives in the future.”
“President.”
Shura, who reached the level of the disciple of wisdom, was unable to understand Amita’s intentions.
“The owner of this world says he will close it. If that’s the case, it’s something we have to accept.”
Veron looked up at the sky.
“However, it is human will.”
Obsession with the present world, eternal life.
Perhaps this is the meaning of himself who has been involved in this world for a long time.
“Jeongjeong.”
Baron thought.
Amitabha Incarnation Technique – Iron pole.
“Keugh!”
Sensing the concentration of the law, Shura jumped straight from the top of the high altar and landed on the ground.
‘Concentration of great thought.’
Veron’s wide-open jaw trembled and a hoarse voice leaked out.
“Ghaaaaaa!”
As the laws of the world twisted, they began to gather at the extreme point of the staff that Veron had struck down.
His will would be planted here with a binding force strong enough not to be pulled out by the waves of time.
-You’re foolish, Amita.
A huge voice spread from the sky.
Then all the clouds in the sky condensed and changed into the shape of Nane’s face.
“Keugh!”
When Shura invoked the incarnation of the disciple Vanya, numerous crosses formed a sphere-shaped defense shield.
The gestalt of union – the strangulation of God.
Just as looking at a stain on a wallpaper and thinking of a meaningful shape, her law combines lies to bring about a phenomenon close to reality.
‘Never be destroyed! I couldn’t even break the maze!’
Even if it was the world of the Under Code that specialized in one’s abilities.
– Don’t be afraid.
Sermon-truth.
From Nane’s forehead, a sword as white as drawing paper was thrust into the god’s stranglehold at the speed of a flash.
“what… … !”
As the closely assembled crosses separated like a chemical reaction, Shura’s face was exposed.
‘This is me.’
He swallowed Ankera’s dream and was the nemesis of Shura, who was closest to being right in this universe.
“Ahhh… … .”
Shura’s shoulders trembled as her butt fell, and Nane’s gaze shifted to Veron.
There was no visible phenomenon, but the iron pole was already completed and nailed to space and time.
-You think I can’t break it?
Veron’s eyes looking up at the sky contained pride and awe at the same time.
“It’s your world, but it’s not like there’s no way to deny it if it’s only me.”
Because Nane’s Kar value is not perfect.
-Someday you will be swept away.
I don’t know how many resets I can endure, but it’s self-evident that eventually it will be destroyed by the waves of time.
Hexa was the only one who could survive.
“Then stop accepting it. I just want to know, is the human mind so insignificant?”
It was the last question Veron threw to the world.
“Even if everything goes back to nothing and there are no records left, the life of an eternal life is to fight until the end.”
Shura suddenly realized.
‘So before the altar opens… … .’
An iron pole was driven into the only point where there was room for reversal, and a fixed and unchanging standard was created.
‘Even if hundreds of futures are mixed, the beginning is always here.’
Veron, the 0.1% of Nane created by Sirone, accurately stabbed that sharp gap.
Perhaps the thought that nothing had been decided passed through Shura’s mind.

[743] Great Purifier (3)
‘A truly formidable obsession.’
The officers of the Tenro Society were those who overcame the fear of death, so Veron’s obsession was also meaningful.
‘But the opponent is me.’
Even though the rulers of each country are already aware of the altar, the reason why they cannot take action is because there is no way to prevent it.
‘There is no way to stop Buddha.’
– Poor girl.
Veron’s iron pole would be an obstacle to the future Nane was planning, but there was no resentment in his voice.
‘Rather pity.’
If obsession causes pain, Veron’s iron pole had reached the limit of obsession that humans can have.
-I will save you from suffering.
The cloud in the shape of Nane clenched its fists and assumed a posture to charge towards Veron.
“Shura, leave.”
“no. I will protect the president.”
Veron pushed his mouth from side to side.
“Sometimes lying is clumsy.”
“… … .”
“I cannot miss this opportunity. Didn’t you wait for today from the moment you became a human without going through reincarnation?”
Veron’s chin swelled like a balloon, and his pupils half-bulged out like toads.
“Only those who kill Buddhas can become Buddhas. My rightness is only right now.”
Shura’s shoulders trembled as her long, blood-red tongue protruded from between Veron’s lips.
‘The president is sincere.’
As she remembers, the last time Veron planned anything with all his might was more than 5,000 years ago.
“Kill me, and I will become the new Buddha.”
-Anyone can become a Buddha.
When the cloud of Nane, over two kilometers in height, rushed to the ground, the vegetation shook terribly.
“President!”
As Shura shouted, Veron raised his wand with mad eyes.
“This is my pole.”
When he struck the ground with his cane, the air shook like a rubber sheet, and a hole was punched through Nane’s clouds.
An evacuation alarm went off in Shura’s head.
‘This is the beginning.’
Given the size of the battle, she would have to move at least 100 kilometers away, but her eyes were still fixed on the battlefield.
I also thought that I had to watch the end of this confrontation until the end because I was not completely flawless.
“conflict!”
As Veron’s staff struck the ground a second time, Nane’s clouds coalesced into a dot in the air and exploded.
Veron murmured as he looked up at the huge belt spreading all the way to the horizon.
“… … Is the real coming?”
In the place where the clouds disappeared, a colorful glow was born, and Nane appeared.
Sermon – Tathagata.
Shura’s lips parted blankly.
‘It looks like it came from far away.’
As the sword of light unfolded around Nane and drew a circle, the son-in-law became so bright that even the sun could not be seen.
Sermon – infinite amount.
In an instant, the brilliance exploded, and as many swords of light as the sun’s rays were shot to the ground.
“Oohhhh!”
Looking up at the light that poured down like a shower, Veron swung his staff at terrifying speed.
Kururrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
A sound like thunder erupted from the ground, and in an instant, a radius of 1 kilometer was devastated.
‘What about the president?’
A thick haze was pushed back, and a powerful voice broke out.
“Are you just claiming to be a Buddha to this extent!”
As Veron rotated his staff and bounced the sword of light, the innumerable sermon caused a diffuse reflection.
“Huh!”
Shura closed her eyes, but the light was so bright that she could see the silhouette of the landscape through her eyelids.
‘Even against the Tathagata, he is equal. maybe this… … .’
Since no one has yet become a god, I, too, do not know the end of my strength, but I am not immortal.
“Because I’m stuck with only me… … .”
Nane spread his arms with a smile, and a gray sword vibrated above his head.
“How can I realize no self?”
Sermon-Gwan.
A gray line was drawn from the sky, and before I knew it, the sword that cut Veron’s cane into pieces was thrust into my chest.
“eww… … .”
Veron, who spread his 10 fingers wide, joined his palms and grabbed the blade just before it pierced his chest.
“Aaaaaaaaaa!”
The law was concentrated between the palms, blocking the penetration of the blade, but the body was pushed back with terrifying speed.
Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!
Even in the midst of being pushed back a kilometer, Veron’s law was being compressed more strongly.
‘I have no choice but to destroy it!’
Just as he was about to crush the blade, Nane rotated with a futile expression and closed his hand again toward Veron.
“Sermon. Big.”
As the gray sword grew bigger without knowing the end, the gap between Veron’s palms gradually widened, and the speed of being pushed rapidly increased.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
“That… … .”
A strange light flashed in Sirone’s eyes as she was looking at the ground in the Temple of the Earth.
In the southern hemisphere, at a certain point in the Kingdom of Iron, a gray sword soared and was vibrating at 7.8 times the size of the planet.
‘No, we are advancing.’
According to the confirmation of the magician’s senses, it was weak, but it was clearly moving at a rate of 1 kilometer per second.
“Amita who can withstand that is also amazing.”
Taesung asked.
“How about this? I know it because I’ve encountered it myself. If it were Sirone, would it be possible to stop the current sermon?”
“yes.”
From a scale perspective, they were roughly similar, and that’s why the universe hasn’t closed yet.
“Extension of an entity that is not an entity. Legally, defense is possible.”
“Hmm.”
Taeseong listened to Sirone’s opinion.
“But I am constantly getting stronger. Eventually, I will reach a point where I can’t handle it.”
That was exactly what Taeseong wanted to say, but it was not yet time to say it out loud.
Neither alone nor many, everyone must fight.
‘Even if it’s impossible… … .’
“Huhhhh!”
At the end of the 18-kilometer scratch that Nane’s sermon coffin carved into the planet, Veron was brutally beaten.
‘Can’t it be blocked?’
A tunnel stretched out to the horizon along his path, and flames blazed around him from the heat.
‘Comes in.’
A scorching pain rushed in as the now immeasurable blade pierced between the palms and landed on the chest.
‘This is my end.’
I suddenly remembered.
‘Why am I… … Had I been so obsessed with life?’
gurgling. gurgling.
By the time Veron didn’t have a name yet, he was nothing more than a lucky-looking poison toad.
Gureuk!
A system that sits somewhere in the pond and jumps and jumps, then stretches out its tongue to swallow the occasional flies that pass by.
‘I want to eat. I want to breed.’
It wasn’t a particularly bad life to repeat the day with the same desire every day.
‘Enemy! nemesis! nemesis! Nemesis!’
It was only when the poisonous toad’s natural enemy snake swallowed Veron in one bite that he realized that fact.
… … .
The snake’s venom was more terrifying than the toad’s, and in the cramped stomach he blinked in terror.
‘Die!’
The reason why he couldn’t even scream was the fate of the creature that was born that way.
‘It’s painful. stuffy. It melts.’
Like many poisonous toads, Veron deserved to be nourished in the snake’s stomach.
‘Dying?’
Everything that makes me disappear.
Meh eh eh! Meh eh eh!
In a situation where he lost consciousness due to the paralyzing poison, Veron cried out with his mouth wide open.
‘I don’t want to die! like this… … like this… … !’
As the concentration of the poison permeated the mucus intensified, the snake’s stomach pressed harder.
help me.
The natural enemy is born with all the abilities to digest prey, but this time it was quite poisonous.
The snake wriggled wildly to speed up digestion, and perhaps that was the end of it.
Sharp teeth pierced the snake’s skin and cut Veron’s back.
rumble! rumble!
The snake’s stomach began spitting out veron again, and the slime prevented the skin from being ripped from the fangs.
When Veron, who escaped outside, looked back, the snake was being bitten by a wild cat.
‘I live!’
If Veron hadn’t struggled, the snake wouldn’t have moved, and the wildcat wouldn’t have spotted them either.
‘Live! Lived!’
After frantically running away and hiding in the depths of the lakeside, Veron fell asleep as if fainting.
rumble.
And when I woke up again, countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
Looking up at the sky, Veron was seized with a strange feeling.
‘It’s a shame.’
Emotions, as they were without words, engulfed his whole body.
The image of himself wriggling wildly inside the snake’s stomach, screaming and screaming for help.
‘Why is it so embarrassing?’
The answer to the first question that came to Veron’s mind when he was born contained a profound logic.
‘Because there is no meaning.’
I couldn’t be so pathetic to see myself struggling without even a reason to live.
‘meaning. The meaning I have to live.’
Realizing the incarnation, the toad looked at the stars in the sky until dawn that night.
‘Did I say obsession?’
As Nane’s sword raced endlessly, Veron’s body began digging into the ground.
‘Maybe it could be.’
All the flesh on his palm had fallen off, and the blade had penetrated from his collarbone to his stomach.
‘But this is my eternal life.’
Even if his body disappears, the meaning he left behind will forever support this world.
‘Death is also life.’
Death will soon become life.
“No shame!”
As Veron struggled with all his might, the world-encompassing law concentrated between his palms.
“conflict!”
Hey hey hey!
Nane’s sword twisted loudly and shattered from the tip of the blade.
“Huh… … .”
Veron, who had managed to keep his balance, twitched his lips as he gazed at the scenery in front of him, reminiscent of a cataclysm.
“Shura, do you have any crabs?”
The space was torn apart and Shura appeared.
“Chairman, are you okay?
“Go to Hexa. Don’t make the meaning I left behind in this world meaningless.”
“No! You know how much I hate that kid! What about the Ten Commandments?”
When Veron’s eyes collided with everything that had been put down, Shura secretly avoided his gaze.
“Why, why do I have to… … .”
Veron tapped Shura on the shoulder.
“… … live on.”
After that, Shura raised her eyebrows as she watched Veron collapse.
“I don’t know, how to live forever… … .”
When I turned around at the sound of footsteps, Nane was approaching me with a calm gesture.
“Did you choose to stay in the end?”
This world had to be closed as soon as possible for Veron, who was unable to go anywhere and was wandering around the Nine Heavens.
“Obsession, do you also want to follow in the footsteps of your ancestors?”
Shura looked down at Veron’s corpse.
-Go to Hexa.
Recalling Veron’s voice, Shura’s eyes grew cold, then turned around and knelt down to Nane.
“What opinion can I dare to give to a person who overwhelms the head of the Council of Ten Lords?”
Shura’s forehead touched the ground.
“I will follow you.”
When Nane nodded and turned around with her hands behind her back, Shura approached behind her.
“What are you going to do?”
“Open the altar.”
The altar where Baron’s iron pole was planted was razed to the ground, but there are still 3.599 altars left in the world.
“Sermon, opening.”
A sword pierced through the sky and flew into space, splitting into thousands of flashes and crashing down.
Taeseong said.
“The Great Purifier has been opened.”

[744] Great Purifier (4)
* * *
The ground shuddered wildly as lightning-like flashes fell on the 3,599 altars spread all over the world.
As Nane’s will seeped in, red light began to leak through the cracks in the bricks, causing confusion among the occupying troops in each country.
“Commander! The altar is about to be opened!”
The adjutant shouted, but the commander checked the map until the end and put the sword around his waist.
“It is a strange thing.”
According to the guide of the temple where the Three Emperors, Chilwangseong, and Prince Lee gathered, there were still 23 hours left before the altar was opened.
“No, is it normal?”
The altar, which was built up to a height of tens of meters, was built so quickly that there was no time to use hands in the kingdom.
History in one day.
Numerous kingdoms have tried to destroy them, but the return result is annihilation.
In the end, the agenda passed into the hands of the temple.
‘But the temple is not transnational either. They will eventually act for the benefit of their country.’
The adjutant reported.
“According to the emergency intelligence, the Iron Kingdom made a last attempt to destroy the altar, but failed. We obtained information about the annihilation of an elite unit last night.”
It was none other than the elite troops of the Seven Kings.
“Report to the kingdom. Current time 14:47. The altar is opening sooner than expected.”
The same report would already be going up in many countries, and the final gathering place was none other than the temple.
“All right.”
An ominous light began to spread as the bricks of the altar disintegrated as if they had lost their gravity.
“I-what is that?”
As the landscape changed, a terrifying world of internal organs, muscles, and bones was revealed.
“Arus! De Mehah!”
As the veil peeled away, those with eyelids closed as if melted and teeth jagged like nails protruded.
Arus, a resident of the other side world.
In the sense of solitude, it was a demon tribe that used its sense of smell to chew up everything around it.
“Aww! Run away!”
The light from the altar quickly engulfed the troops, and as Arus appeared close by, the soldiers lost their will to fight.
“damn! Full army retreat! It even draws in the ‘guidelines’!”
The temple notified the world of its response, and the radius they measured was outside of two kilometers.
‘It is too late. I’ll take full control in 30 minutes.’
Demons were taking over the world.
* * *
Sadness filled Sirone’s eyes as he looked down at the planet from the Temple of Earth.
“at last… … .”
What happened because he couldn’t stop it.
“It opened sooner than expected. Amita’s decision made Nane impatient.”
Just as humanity knew Nane’s intentions, Nane also knew humanity’s movements as if looking into the palm of their hand.
“Nane sympathizes with life, so I don’t want to waste time. I was aiming for the perfect timing, with no room for counterattack.”
“It’s an acceleration of enlightenment.”
“yes. According to my calculations, if the Carr number goes over 10 million decimal places, even Sirone will have a hard time blocking it.”
It’s 1 percent in 10 million places, which is almost like nothing, but it was a huge gap in the ultimate realm.
“It takes about 48 hours to get there. Perhaps the temple was predicted based on this information, but I think I did not properly calculate the variable of the Order of the Crusade.”
Amitabha’s presence was felt in that it could advance the time promised by the Buddha by more than 20 hours.
“How long will it take?”
Thousands of red dots spread across the continent were growing rapidly at a rate that could be seen with the naked eye.
It gave me goosebumps when I imagined what people living on the ground would be going through at this speed just by looking at it from space right now.
“That red light is called the psychic realm, and it erases the veil between the underworld and the real world. It should be enough to cover the entire planet in a day or so.”
“How can I stop it?”
Taeseong shook his head.
“It is not something that can be physically broken. That is a system, not a material.”
“It’s the Akashic Records.”
“yes. Only beings with the highest authority can handle the Akashic Records directly. To express it as a creature, it is a law that operates in the 10th sense, the state of ignorance.”
Anke Ra was a being with a 10th sense, and that authority was now completely passed on to Nane.
“When the altar was built, Louver once attempted to enter La Enemy’s dream. But Louver is also a product of the Akashic Records. It was erased as soon as I logged in.”
because of the lack of authority.
“Therefore, in order to destroy the altar, Nane, who inherited the dream of Ankera, must do it himself… … .”
Nane destroyed an altar in Iron Kingdom.
“We have no choice but to infiltrate and destroy concepts that are not in the Akashic Records.”
“… … That’s what I have to do.”
“yes. Only sirone is out of the whole. So, this is Sirone’s first mission. Please seal the altar.”
Sirone recalled 3,599 altars.
“I can’t make it on time. By the time the seal is over, there will be no one left alive.”
“They will buy you time.”
When Sirone made a puzzled expression, Taeseong floated the scenery of a huge ice continent on the ceiling of the Temple of Earth.
“They are people that Sirone knows.”
As the radius of the psychic sphere rapidly expanded, 680,000 deaths occurred worldwide in 10 minutes.
The problem was that the real world and the other side world were using the same space, just hidden behind a curtain.
In a situation where the walls of the royal castle, ancient weapons, and any concealment facilities are useless… … .
“I approve the Zion project.”
Representatives of the Samhwanggye, Chilwangseong, and Prince Lee who gathered at the temple in 18 minutes and 42 seconds after the altar opened signed the documents.
The document fell into the hands of Valkyrie’s best information wizard and crossed the continent at the speed of light.
“Mr. Miro, your approval has dropped.”
It was transferred to Armin, the Eternal Reflector, and passed into the hands of Miro, the representative of Zion.
“It’s too late! After all, politicians!”
Their help was needed to run the Sanctuary of the Lawyers, which was supported by 48 countries around the world.
“Let’s start. The more time you take, the greater the damage.”
Miro nodded at Quan’s words and opened his mouth as he looked directly at Nane across Antarctica.
“I will gather everyone’s will. From now on, we will reduce the realm of the psychic realm as much as possible.”
The icy earth blazed like flames as torches rose from the 700 totems lined up behind her in two rows.
long-awaited silence.
“… … .”
Between the two rows of pillars stretching towards the continent, 37,000 religious leaders from all over the world were lined up tightly.
Looking up at Miro’s face filling the ceiling of the Temple of the Earth, Sirone’s heart was moved.
‘I didn’t give up.’
Veron disappeared, but there were still countless people who stood against Nane.
“Did Mr. Miro plan it?”
“yes. When Ankera resets the world for her third time, she feels like only she foresaw.”
The hexa created by Guffin to prevent the reset of the world, and the person who carried through the hexa was Miro.
“Of course, the memory of Istas was erased along with Guffin, but the insight circuit is still there.”
Anke Ra wanted to become a god, but he could never surpass the whole just by repeating the reset.
“So only beings who can shut themselves off are gods.”
As a result, Miro’s old woman’s heart paid off.
“The stronger the resistance, the more the world will suffer, but with this I bought time.”
Taeseong looked back at the maze and said.
“He is the one who protected the world from Heaven’s army for 20 years. In terms of defense, it is by far the best of mankind. It won’t be easy for me this time either.”
Sirone’s two fists gained strength.
‘I can still fight more.’
It was a fact that I could be sure of because it was Adrias Miro and no one else.
“Humans are not your exclusive property, it is me.”
Miro raised her hands as the embodiment of Guanyin with a thousand hands filled the Antarctic sky.
“Ohhhhh.”
Numerous monks seated behind her followed her gestures as if commanding the law, concentrating their consciousness.
Leaders of 984 denominations, including the Church of Yore, the Monastery of Karsis, and the monks of the Eastern Middle Heaven, called the ivory tower of the world of salvation, all gathered in one place.
‘These are almost all lines that exist in the world.’
I won’t be evil
“But that is also something we will define.”
In order to activate the seesaw of the law, it was appropriate to refer to Nane as evil.
‘It’s decreasing.’
From space, Sirone watched as the realm of the psychic realm was rapidly shrinking.
‘This is the Adrias Maze.’
He was the teacher who taught Sirone the meaning of life.
“Push a little more!”
Following Miro’s instructions, the scribes moved in perfect order, strengthening their will.
At the same time, the torches exploded from 700 totems and ascended into a huge pillar of fire.
Even the cold of Antarctica was blown by the heat, but those who had already entered samadhi did not even feel it.
‘The ignorant bastard.’
Miro’s eyes became ferociously powerful.
‘How can you do this with a human body… … .’
It was inevitably confronted with Nane by the seesaw of the law, but it was a strong will that made me feel awe.
‘Yes, you are the closest to God. Eat it all!’
The size of the torch was getting weaker little by little.
‘Honestly, this is too much!’
The fear of the psychic realm lies in breaking down the barrier between the real world and the hidden world that uses the same space.
It was that the defenses built by humans would lose their meaning, so the main task of the Zion Project was to reduce the area of the psychic realm to at least 1 kilometer or less.
‘The boundary must not collapse.’
If it was just a hole, even if demons invaded, human war could be waged in human territory.
“damn!”
Suddenly, curse words came out of Miro’s mouth.
‘Asmodians are not good.’
That’s why it’s called the demon, but he was also a hidden being created by humans.
“Mr. Miro, you must forgive me.”
Armin hurriedly spoke as Miro’s mind was shaken at the extreme of concentration.
“If you collapse, it’s over.”
Miro felt as if he could hear Armin’s voice from far away.
‘Even when the world destroyed the Adrias family, I was not shaken. But this… … .’
Isn’t that too absurd?
‘Why do good people suffer?’
Armin shouted.
“Relax! Sirone has already forgiven everyone’s sins. This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity!”
“Huhhhh!”
The sequence of the maze, which had reached a plateau of acceleration, began to run at a terrifying speed again.
‘Sirone, how could you forgive me?’
Just as Nane’s achievements were marvelous, Sirone’s philanthropy was no less marvelous.
‘I can’t be pushed by my disciple!’
Finally, when the maze sequence reached the mysterious state of 10 to the 64th power, the flames of the totem pierced the sky.
“Never give up.”
As if time had been turned back, the realm of the psychic realm was shrinking towards the point where it was first born.
Radius of the psychic realm, 17.4 km.

[745] The Age of Turbulence (1)
“You foolish middle school student.”
Anger raged in Nane’s eyes as she looked up at the sky from deep in the forest.
“Do you really see hope in this world?”
The heart may be larger than the universe, but isn’t it human beings who betray that heart as if turning the palm of their hand?
Is it natural for creatures to be selfish?
“That too is just an illusion caused by being trapped in the existence of me.”
“Nane-sama, how about hitting the Antarctic?”
Shura opened her mouth.
“… … Someday it will.”
If the law could be removed right away, the psychic realm would not have shrunk so drastically.
A creature’s formidable obsession with life.
‘Veron, Sirone, Miro… … .’
The Kar figure that exceeds 99% is sucking up the remaining truth in the world like a black hole.
But since it can never be perfect, I had to know what was missing about human beings.
“In the future, great chaos is coming to the world. The law will have no choice but to pass on to me anyway.”
You will all know how cruel humans are and why this world has to be closed.
* * *
“little bit more!”
Miro’s gaze was aimed straight at the laws of the world even as bloody tears flowed from her blood vessels.
The radius of the psychic realm is 4.4 kilometers.
‘We have to shorten it even by 100 meters! No, even 10 meters!’
It is estimated that approximately 300 humans can survive per 1 meter radius.
oh oh oh oh
The monks of Jungcheon-dong backed up the law with the lowest pitch a human being could make.
Miro’s eyes went up.
‘no! That’s it!’
If you continue to be greedy, the law of Zion will be destroyed, and even your efforts so far will be in vain.
“Put it through!”
The totem caught in the flames ascended into the sky forming 700 pillars of fire.
“I walked.”
In the future, as long as Zion is not destroyed, the 700 pillars of fire that will never be extinguished will prevent the expansion of the psychic realm.
“You did it. we did it.”
While the jurists looked up at the sky with an expression of disbelief even after seeing it with their own eyes, Miro’s eyes were fierce.
“Annoying… … .”
The final radius of the psychic realm is 1.43 kilometers.
A radius of 430 meters wider than the original target means that there are approximately 100,000 more deaths.
“It’s great that you’ve come this far against me. You can be proud of it.”
Armin comforted her.
‘No, honestly, I didn’t expect to make it this far.’
It was not an achievement achieved only by the depth of the realm.
It was the result of the skillful skill of blocking all the armies of Heaven with the dimensional barrier.
“are you okay. Nothing has been accomplished yet.”
Miro proclaimed to the world.
“The fight starts now.”
Project Zion.
It was the name of mankind’s last legal line of deterrence against Nane’s exploits.
* * *
As the psychic realm shrunk, the armies of each country, which were instructed by the Holy War, pushed the demons from the guidelines.
“Shoot! Shoot!”
It was impossible to seal the altar, but at least I had to buy time to set up a barricade outside the psychic realm.
A situation that takes 36 hours even if you use the ultra-fast barrier construction formula developed by the world’s best architects.
The way the temple chose to tie the demons to the passage of the other world, even for a moment, was extremely simple.
“No need to save! I’m going to throw it all away!”
The spectacle of thousands of archers simultaneously firing magic bullets in all 360-degree directions around the psychic realm was spectacular.
All materials were provided by the temple, and approximately 9 million tons of magic bullets were to be supplied to each country in 36 hours.
‘What kind of money is this!’
When converted into money, it amounted to 1.3 trillion gold, and the soldiers simply bounced their bows day and night toward the point where the bombing was being done.
The commander raised his telescope and looked in the direction of the altar.
‘It’s a possible strategy because it’s a holy war. And sure.’
There must have been discussions among the demons in the underworld, but they didn’t dare to come out right now.
The commander slowly lowered the telescope.
‘But there is bound to be a limit to the quantity.’
Where the sunset was setting, the hideous steel frames were going up at a terrifying speed.
‘Everyone is fighting.’
Sirone looked back at everything happening on the planet from the perspective of Taeseong.
Taesung’s expression was also spleen.
“Miro finally made it.”
“Yes, sorry. If only I could push a little harder… … .”
“Rather, Zion would have been destroyed.”
Sirone knew it too.
Even so, the reason why lingering lingering was the number of people with good will that were far less than the population.
‘I have to do it.’
Sirone turned to Taeseong and said.
“I can’t just watch it like this. I want to go down to the ground I will seal the altar.”
“Sure. But the time Sirone has to step in is after the barricades are completed.”
In my mind, I wanted to leave right away.
“Sirone, being a star is a position that should not promote the interests of a specific country or a specific person. If Syrone seals the altar of a certain country in advance, human quarrels intensify.”
Sirone kept his mouth shut.
“Sirone has to do transnational activities outside of human life. You shouldn’t kill someone out of the desire to save someone’s life. Causing trouble only serves Nane’s purposes.”
The reason why billions are falling is because there are people who miss you so much.
“… … All right.”
family, friends and lovers.
Taeseong looked with pity on Sirone, who had left her personal bondage and was carrying a huge burden.
“Take this.”
As Taeseong raised both hands, a pentagram pendant, symbolizing a star, appeared and floated to Sirone.
“This?”
“The key to planet Hexa. It’s only symbolic to Sirone, but you shouldn’t get lost.”
Using the material, he was able to dismantle the Hexa Key in atomic units and obtain a blueprint.
“thank you. I will cherish it. Of course, I don’t think I’ll be able to find Hexa right now.”
Taeseong understood Sirone’s feelings.
No matter how much you enter the state of infinity, you cannot be without a mind as long as you return to this world.
No, because only my heart was left, I would miss the person I love even more.
“Stop going down. Louvers and minis await. I will show you the house to live in.”
Sirone said, floating the light of Yahweh on her palm.
“yes. I’ll see you when we leave.”
Taeseong does not forbid the stars to enter.
It was only because there was no way to meet her, but Sirone could come to her at any time.
‘Going down.’
Just as they arrived at the Earth Temple, the law opened the way and Sirone’s body disappeared in an instant.
A smile spread across Taeseong’s lips as Louver would be preparing a present for Sirone.
“This is the only thing I can do for you who sacrificed for humanity… … .”
It was a sad smile.
“Please have a pleasant dream… … .”
Under the Temple of Earth, at the top of the physically tallest Ivory Tower, Louver and Mini were waiting.
“Are you finished talking?”
“He was a good man.”
Taeseong was cozy like a mother.
“It is. I will guide you where to stay.”
When I reached the 400th floor by elevator, I saw a small village with rice fields, mountains and streams outside the door.
“A star does not live in a particularly independent space. It’s just going into the house that’s left.”
“yes. I like it.”
Originally, civilization was built in nature, but the ivory tower contained nature in civilization.
‘How big is the building?’
It was a pity that I couldn’t see the Ivory Tower from the outside because I came inside through the magic circle.
Sirone’s house was a two-story wooden building with a red roof and had an antique atmosphere.
Minnie asked.
“Are you leaving as soon as the barricade is completed?”
Since only Syrone can seal the altar, she thought of applying to the other side.
“Then I will go to the southern hemisphere and investigate the traces of Veron. Maybe you can get some hints.”
Louver nodded.
“I will instruct the other stars in our department to help with the demon suppression operation.”
It was a simple thing to convey through a dream.
“The inhabitants of the Underworld are strong. A lot of people will die or suffer in the future.”
“If there is someone you want to protect, protect it.”
At Mini’s words, Sirone turned her head.
“I know what Taeseong said. That is the fate of the stars. But you’ve already saved everyone. At least you deserve to save at least someone you love.”
Sirone shook her head.
“The moment I cling to it, the kar will go up and I will lose the light of Yahweh. The law is out of balance.”
“You can’t stand it. I have enough strength to protect it, so would it be okay if the person I loved died?”
“It won’t be okay.”
I used to say this
-You are the one who suffers the most.
A terrible contradiction that humanity was protected through philanthropy, but no one who loved it could be protected.
‘I shouldn’t be human. I have to keep myself in check only as a concept.’
It was the reason for Hexa’s existence.
“For now, let’s focus on the altar. Once the barricades are set up, we will start with the nearest one.”
Tormia is far from the Ivory Tower, so it was not a human decision, and tears of blood flowed from my heart.
Louver said.
“I agree. It is a situation where only a decision to save humanity is possible.”
Mini turned her head at the unexpected cold words, but Louver smiled benevolently.
“but… … Everyone can have a dream.”
Sirone blinked at the incomprehensible words.
* * *
Tormia Kingdom.
At Amy’s home in Creas City, 200 armed men were impregnably encamped.
Amy’s father, Shakora, who had been to the Creas branch of the Magic Association, entered the mansion with cold eyes.
“honey! How did it go?”
As the psychic realm expanded to the aristocratic district, the bodies of dead demons were strewn along the roadside.
“There has been great damage in the mountainous regions. 7,000 deaths nationwide. Still, it seems to have stopped it once.”
“What will happen to Tormia in the future?”
In the face of the worst catastrophe in human history, even the hostess of a first-class aristocrat was just a human being.
“The firepower demonstration only temporarily tied the feet of the demons, and even the barricades couldn’t last long.”
If Amy hadn’t been at home, Isis, who would have already become food for the demons, trembled.
“I heard Sirone went into the ivory tower.”
Amy, who was bowing her head from battle fatigue, looked back at Isis for the first time.
“I’m not sure. Still, it seems that he played a key role in preventing this incident.”
That was all the information Shakora had received.
“I heard that the place where Sirone is is safe from demons… … .”
The Ivory Tower and Zion were the only places left untouched by the terrible disaster.
“If only my family could go there… … .”
“mom!”
Amy jumped up.
“What are you talking about! How could you think that we should live alone!”
“Amy, what are you doing to your mother?”
Shakora’s nerves were on edge when she returned home after seeing the gruesome corpses.
“You will be a soldier, but not everyone is a soldier. It is natural to be afraid of a mother who cannot fight.”
“But that’s nonsense.”
Isis vomited out words in frustration.
“Why don’t you make sense? Even if it’s okay to go to the ivory tower, shouldn’t a message come at least when the kingdom has reached this point? I’m not even close to you… … .”
Amy couldn’t resist.
“that… … .”
Among all mankind, there is Sirone and Nane.
It is difficult for a man who is just a thinking reed to understand the two people who have gone through conflict.
But now that the world is on the brink of destruction, it was they who came up with the most truthful answer.
“Sorry. I’m tired, so I’ll go in first and sleep.”
“Amy… … .”
Realizing that it was her daughter who felt most betrayed, Isis tried to speak out, but Amy went into the room.
“I must have made a mistake.”
“Leave it alone. don’t get hurt by this After a good night’s sleep, your mind will be clear.”
That night, Louver appeared in Amy’s dream.

[746] The Age of Turbulence (2)
* * *
“Sometimes he told me to meet another guy!”
Amy, who came into the room to avoid Isis’s nagging, sat down on the bed with a sigh.
“I know someone stays still because they like something!”
The anger quickly subsided.
Isis had a point, and her fear was a normal human reaction.
‘What will happen to this world?’
The psychic realm that has arisen in each region of the world will shake the world situation more than the problem of demons appearing.
‘Many deaths, civil war, war with other countries… … .’
Being a soldier will be the toughest job.
Perhaps it was the only chance to change her dream for Amy who was preparing for the official exam.
‘Sirone.’
Even when I graduated, I thought we could live a happy life dreaming of a future together.
‘What am I to you?’
Exhausted from the fight with the demons, Amy fell asleep without knowing how she had landed on the bed.
Tears streamed down between my eyelids.
“It’s been a while, Miss Amy.”
“uh?”
When I heard the voice and turned around, I felt that I was a familiar person somewhere.
An elderly man with a mustache and a benevolent smile.
Only he had vivid colors as if he were alive, and reason flooded into the realm of deep 6th level REM.
“Where is this?”
Realizing that it was a dream, the landscape became clearer, revealing a green field with all sorts of rare flowers.
“what? uh?”
I have had the experience of being crushed by scissors while dreaming sometimes, but this was the first time I had ever fully awakened.
Finally realizing, Amy looked back at the old man.
“no way?”
“Yes, my name is Mongin Louver, the dream keeper.”
I knew that only those who obtained a lucid dream license through special training could find a louver.
“Did you come directly to me?”
“yes. Originally, it is forbidden by the Terra Force Cosmic Law for a dream keeper to forcibly awaken an individual’s dream, but the situation was such that I came forward myself.”
It was already notified to the Supreme Court of Terraforce, and given that Sirone is the representative of humanity, it was approved.
“Why are you looking for me?”
“There is someone who wants to meet Miss Amy. If you don’t mind, may I connect you to his dream… … .”
Amy was a little nervous in that Mong-in was a person who used honorifics.
“Who are you?”
“I cannot tell you that. But I assure you, I don’t think you’ll ever get slapped by Miss Amy.”
Amy, who pursed her lips and was lost in thought, happily made her decision.
“great. It’s a dream anyway, so what?”
“Then, have a good time.”
Louver’s body gradually turned transparent and then completely disappeared.
“what?”
Amy was looking around when she suddenly heard a familiar voice behind her.
“Amy.”
She shrugged and slowly turned around with a shocked face, and Sirone stood there with a smile on her face.
“you you… … ?”
“Sorry for coming to you like this. but… … .”
Even though I knew it was a dream, as soon as I saw her face, the resentment that had been bothering me so far exploded.
“You bastard!”
Amy shouted as she grabbed Sirone by the collar.
“How could I not even contact you? Should I listen through my dad?”
Sirone just had an apologetic expression.
“Do you know how embarrassed I was? Mama tells me to meet another guy, people say I’ve been dumped! But how… … To me… … .”
Sirone hugged Amy tightly.
“I miss you.”
Amy knew.
There are feelings that are so huge and desperate that no exaggerated language can describe them.
‘know. I know that.’
The mind is bigger than the universe.
“ha. Anyway, since you came, I will forgive you.”
Tears welled up in Shirone’s eyes as well, as she held Amy’s shoulder and dropped herself.
“but! Before that, there is something I must check!”
What the hell does this guy think of me?
“You said you came through a dream, right? It’s not like you came to see me because of your personality. What number am I?”
“Definitely the first.”
Sirone responded hurriedly, looked at her as if she couldn’t overcome her guilt, and then spoke cautiously.
“in fact… … It is the way to meet my parents first.”
Amy smiled broadly.
“Then it’s the first one. Let’s go, you’ll have to tell us everything about what happened.”
Cirone, holding Amy’s hand, nodded and ran across the meadow.
I saw a small house where there were butterflies flying like fragments of light over the flower field.
It was all painted pink, and Amy, who was caught unconscious, covered her mouth and cleared her throat.
“Hmmmm.”
It was the reason why the dream connection was banned in Terraforce.
However, since the opponent was Sirone, rather than embarrassed, he felt thrilled.
“… … Let’s go in.”
Amy spoke shyly, and Sirone followed her with an inexplicable smile.
“Amy, I have something to tell you.”
“know. In a hurry… … .”
Since we didn’t have much time, Sirone told us the things we absolutely needed to know.
As the story progressed, the candles made various changes, and when she finally learned the whole story, her room was dark.
“so I… … .”
“I see what you mean.”
Amy interrupted Sirone.
“Why didn’t you contact me, what should you do in the future?”
The candle was lit again.
“But it’s okay. It’s unavoidable. It’s good that I have a clear goal. Let’s work together to finish me off.”
“no. It’s not on that level.”
Since this would be the last chance to deal with someone with a human mind, Sirone struggled to open her mouth.
“Amy, I can’t be with you anymore.”
“what?”
Amy’s house is completely dark.
“I am so happy to be with you like this. I am so unbearably happy that I am going crazy.”
“But what’s wrong? Why are you doing this all of a sudden?”
“This is it. That I’m so happy. In the end, I’m going to obsess over you. And when that happens… … .”
Sirone bit his lip.
“I will definitely use it. The more I love you, the more dangerous you become.”
“Am I a Buddha? What kind of Buddha would do such a cowardly thing?”
“That’s human emotion too.”
Sirone looked back at Amy’s face beyond the darkness.
“To me, everything in this world is futile. It doesn’t matter what you do to close the world.”
Because it doesn’t exist from the beginning.
“You have already transcended the concept of good and evil. The realm of a god who has reached the end of all good and all evil.”
It would be a lie if I said I wasn’t afraid.
“And I can’t protect someone and fight someone like that. So Amy, stop… … .”
“okay. Let’s stop.”
At the sudden cold voice, Sirone’s heart sank as he couldn’t bear to speak.
“Haha, I knew that. What kind of love is this in this situation? You don’t have to worry about me in the future. You just have to fight me in your place, whatever you want. Are you done now?”
He exhaled without hesitation, but could not hide the sound of the wind blowing outside.
“Because I will go.”
Like the sound of the wind, Amy sobbed.
“Because it will become so strong that you don’t need to protect it. So, I will definitely go to you… … .”
Something hot and wet spread from Sirone’s chest, holding Amy in her arms.
“Don’t worry, just wait. I’ll go. Wherever you are and whoever you are fighting, I will be by your side.”
Growing stronger and stronger, I will punch Nane in the face.
“Amy… … .”
Sirone couldn’t hold back the tears either, and the two stroked each other’s faces in the dark.
If only I could hug her even now.
‘Because it’s a dream. It’s a dream between the two of us.’
Their lips, which had almost stuck together, lost their way and wandered, and only the emotions between the two were terribly stirred.
“I’ll go. You have to be careful.”
“no. can’t go sirone… … wait for a sec… … .”
I thought I was ready, but when it came to reality, I couldn’t accept it.
“Sorry. I’m sorry, Amy.”
Wouldn’t it be better to love madly until the end of the world and then end it all together?
The moment a very humane thought passed through her head, Sirone closed her eyes tightly, kicked off the bed, and left the house.
“Sirone! wait, wait… … !”
Amy’s dream ended there.
* * *
“Aaaaaaa!”
In front of Sirone, who was crouching and crying in her dream, Louver approached with a sad expression.
“Don’t be angry.”
“Why, why me! why me… … why!”
“Forgive me.”
With the two words spoken firmly, Sirone’s breathing quickly died down.
“ha. ha.”
‘Are you accepting it again? It’s a formidable spirit.’
Neither Sirone nor Nane were born as gods.
The base was human to the end, but even so, it was a spirit of this level, so it was to cross the realm of a god.
“This is just the beginning. The Great Purifier has just opened. If you are not bold, you will kill yourself.”
There was no guarantee that that would not happen.
“sorry. It’s something Mr. Louver did especially for me.”
“I am truly sorry. I knew the truth. But in reality, if Sirone-sama becomes a human, the world will close.”
That’s why it was confirmed as a dream.
“Do you want to go back?”
“no. This is your last chance when you don’t have a stronger obsession. I want to let as many people know as possible.”
Oh Dae-seong’s mission had already begun.
“Take me to your friends.”
Louver muttered in a subdued voice.
“Have a nice dream… … .”
* * *
“Ugh. Ugh.”
Hearing Nade’s voice at dawn, Liz, who was sleeping next to her, shook her body.
“Nade? Is it a nightmare?”
They were the ones who fought the demons all day long to get out of the psychic realm.
“Is it because you’re tired?”
“Is this really a dream?”
Louver delivered everything, but Nade, who had not experienced Drimo, was dubious.
“Puhaha! What do you know! Whoa, sirone!”
Nade ran to it with a happy heart, but as soon as he saw Sirone’s face, his expression hardened.
“… … What’s wrong, Sirone?”
why are you crying
“Nade.”
“what’s the matter? Did something bad happen?”
It was the first time Sirone cried so sadly.
“Who bullied you! tell me what kind of guy you are! I’ll go and smash it right now!”
“Nade, I… … .”
It was a long dream.
“Huh!”
Nade, who woke up from his slumber, exhaled a rough breath as he raised his upper body.
“are you okay?”
When he heard Liz’s voice and looked around, the scenery of the inn room, which was evacuated from the demons, felt unfamiliar.
“Did the demons dream? No matter how much I woke up, I didn’t wake up… … .”
“It is not a dream.”
Sirone said it was me.
“Get ready, Liz. Let’s go back to Tormia right now. I have to meet Iruki. They are probably waiting for me.”
“Tormia?”
As the psychic realm overtakes the capital, Nade takes Liz straight across the border.
Anyway, Ned has nothing to do with patriotism, but as Liz, a full-time member of the Magic Association, this was something she should never have done.
“Don’t you know what the capital is like right now? You will be arrested as soon as you go. What else is Iruki waiting for?”
“Sirone is having a hard time.”
“… … .”
The reason Liz cannot refute is that they are two people who have gained a new life because of Sirone.
“Some madman is messing with my friend.”
It was none of Nade’s concern about the heights Sirone had mentioned.
“So you really want to go? now?”
“I can give up my country as much as I want to protect the people I love, but… … .”
Nade put on his jacket and said.
“If you bully my friend, even the Buddha will not forgive you.”
That was Nade.
“ha. So, what are men? You can’t live without dying.”
Carrying his backpack over his shoulder, Nade looked back at Liz and raised an eyebrow.
“let’s go. A Buddha or a dog bone… … .”
If man is the problem, he will rule man.
“I’ll show you what happens if you mess with Sirone’s gang.”

[747] The Age of Turbulence (3)
* * *
Tormia Kingdom.
A month has passed since the Great Cleanup began.
Martial law had already been declared throughout the country, and even nobles could not enter the aristocratic district of Creas without a pass.
The demons that appeared when the psychic realm expanded were almost destroyed.
However, a few remnants, such as hungry ghosts, were still hiding in secluded places and targeting women.
“You guys are getting really sick of it.”
Magicians from the Creas branch of the Magic Association and royal castle correspondents were patrolling the street corner.
“Because what they eat is not the body. The act of eating is eating. If there is something to eat in front of my eyes, I will put it in my mouth and try it even if my stomach bursts.”
The body of an aristocratic woman found three days ago was horribly mutilated.
“In any system, the stronger ones absorb the weaker ones. In other words, the act of eating is evidence of superiority.”
Humans eat almost anything.
“Massive stars absorb light stars. But the problem is that the biological system is based on pleasure. That’s probably why demons mutilate corpses.”
Countries around the world had already figured out the size and fighting power of the demons and the people of interest.
The cold-blooded analysis of the investigator was part of it, but the accompanying wizard did not like it.
“There is nothing different about being human.”
The investigator smiled.
“It is surprisingly sentimental. I heard wizards are cold.”
“well. Now that the world has gotten to this point, I feel that just keeping my cool is not the best thing.”
Everything humankind had built was collapsing.
The insight that maybe the answer might be in the heart suddenly passed through my mind.
“Of course, we know that demons are the other side of humans. It is said that it is a law created by a strong desire. But demons are demons after all. Most humans don’t rape women passing by or take possessions.”
the investigator added softly.
“… … I don’t know what you’re thinking on the inside.”
Why do demons exist?
As I turned the corner of the alley with such thoughts in mind, the wizard stopped walking and raised his arm.
“stop.”
The wizards who followed immediately entered the spirit zone, and the investigator narrowed his eyes and slowly fell back.
“Who are you? Identify yourself.”
The person walking in the dark had no answer, but the sound of heavy footsteps felt intimidating.
“Shining.”
As the wizards in the back cast magic at the same time, the son-in-law brightened and a swordsman covered in blood appeared.
“Uh-oh… … .”
Judging by the amount of clotted blood, it seemed that he hadn’t washed it for a week, but his eyes were terrifying as if he had just been born.
Lian, who had arrived at Creas after crossing the Akkad Desert, distorted his impression.
Hardened crusts fell off the back of the head.
“What are you guys?”
The metropolitan area or national key points were well prepared for altars, but numerous demons came out and ran the game at the altars installed in the desert, which were wider than large kingdoms.
Because he was on his way back to his hometown after sweeping them all away, Lian’s mind was sharp enough to be cut just by touching it.
“Are you a demon?”
The investigator’s remarks were so heinous that they couldn’t be said as a joke, so the wizard spoke hostilely.
“I am a wizard of the Creas branch of the Magic Association. I’m patrolling the grounds. He cannot come in without a pass.”
“Patrol within the territory?”
Lian raised her head and looked up at the stars in the night sky.
“You are suffering. I am Ogentrian. I’m on my way home, so would you like me to get out of the way?”
“Oh, August Lian?”
The Ogent family is famous in Creas.
However, the reason the wizard was surprised was because of the name Lian, not the prestige of the family.
“Knight of Maha. Are you really Sirone’s sword?”
Few people know Sirone’s face, but the world knows the names of Sirone, a 5-star resident of the Ivory Tower, and his sword, Lian.
As Lian, who was tired and did not want to respond, moved slowly, the wizards raised their magical weapons.
“stop! You cannot pass by without identifying yourself.”
“If I were Lian, there would be no such thing. Your family will vouch for you if you follow me to my parents’ house.”
It seems reasonable at first glance, but most of the ganja came out this way, so they issued a pass.
“Then wait here. We’ll go to Ogent’s home and check. As with the demons, the situation is not good.”
Lian entered without hesitation into the spirit zone where five wizards were spreading at the same time.
“I cut thousands of demons while crossing the desert.”
The tribes of the desert swept away by the demons all perished, and their end was to the point that I did not dare to speak of them.
“But after cutting, cutting, and cutting again, I mean. Rather, they hated humans, not demons.”
The wizard’s heart beat faster as Lian approached.
“I don’t want to waste time.”
‘I can’t win.’
The moment you try to do something, your neck will drop.
“So please, as soon as possible.”
The wizards’ tension disappeared like a lie.
The young man, who just casually looked up at the sky with a large sword on his back, may not have shown any intention to kill himself from the beginning.
‘I was mistaken myself. He didn’t even think of fighting us… … .’
It was so strong that he was terrified.
“Back off.”
At the direction of the magician, the subordinates left the road open, and the inspector leaned against the wall with a groan.
“Thank you for fighting for humans.”
The mage bowed respectfully, and Lian nodded as well and pushed her way between them.
‘Will the house be safe?’
The blood had been erased, but the fingernail marks of the hungry demons mercilessly scratched every wall, weighing on my heart.
“Rian! You’re all right!”
When I arrived at the main house guided by sub-butler Temuran, Reina ran out barefoot.
The smell of blood was strong from Lian’s body, but even that was someone else’s blood, so Reina was relieved.
“I thought something had happened and I was worried! to be careless How come you don’t have a letter?”
It was Lian who was puzzled.
“Why is your sister at home?”
Even if it wasn’t just a battle, the things she had to do as a court musician in the royal palace were overwhelming.
“I brought them.”
Ogent Klumph came down the stairs.
“grandfather.”
“What happened? I heard that Sirone passed the Ivory Tower Test, but… … .”
Reina stopped talking.
“Rinse off first. I’ll prepare dinner soon. Butler, please hurry up with the remaining ingredients.”
“All right.”
Butler Louis bowed his head with a bandage on his right arm, which had been severed below the elbow.
It was a wound inflicted by a demon.
Lian asked Klump without showing any emotion.
“What about your older brother?”
Ogent Guy, the eldest son of the family.
He passed the official exam early and took up an important position in the kingdom of Tormia, but his older brother became a spy due to his strong patriotism.
“I do not know. No contact for 3 years. They are still active in other countries, or they must have died.”
Guy was a painful name in the Ogent family.
“okay… … .”
Klump, who was staring at Lian as he headed for the bathroom, asked.
“Are you thinking of wandering the world again? this hell?”
“It should be.”
The grandson was proud, but on the other hand, he also wanted Lian to remain in Tormia and protect his sister.
“It’s a big deal to break up with Sirone. Wasn’t it between the two of us dying together?”
“… … That’s why he left.”
Although he didn’t know what state was, he knew that he couldn’t compensate for Sirone’s pain.
“It gets harder when I’m by your side. I will find a way to help Sirone in my own way.”
Klump realized he couldn’t hold on to Lian.
“Follow me to the training ground.”
Lian and Raina looked back curiously, but Clump strode out of the mansion with a broad back.
Lian’s personal training ground.
Lian and Klump stood facing each other 10 meters apart as Reina watched with an uneasy expression.
‘It’s been a while.’
A place where I ran 100 laps every day after being beaten to death by the sword master Kite.
It was also the place where he lost in a real battle with Sirone, who became his reason for living.
‘Why did Grandpa choose this place… … .’
It must have meant a final look back to the grandson who was throwing himself into the irreversible future.
“Are you ready?”
Clump said with speculation.
“yes.”
Although Lian competed against numerous swordsmen through knight training, it was the first time he faced a certified third-class swordsman.
In terms of the military, it was a general level corresponding to a division commander, and above that there were only two corps commanders and one captain.
“Are the men in this family dueling on a fictitious day?”
Now is the time to adapt, but this time Reina couldn’t keep her legs still.
‘Grandpa is sincere.’
It felt like I could see the haze of speculation emanating from Klump even in the dark, where I could barely see through the torchlight.
“You must have crossed many dead lines. For the sake of my grandson’s face, I’ll do my best to kill him.”
Lian’s expression still did not change, and he posed slowly enough to make the viewer sleepy.
“… … .”
Klump, who was staring at Lian with his eyes wide open like a tiger, suddenly lowered his sword and held out his hand.
“Give it up.”
“Give me what?”
“<Idea>. It’s mine, so I’ll fight with it.”
Lian narrowed her stride and said with an absurd face.
“Why is this your grandfather’s sword? It is mine because it was given to me.”
“But aren’t the two of us fighting now? Then of course I should use it, why do you use it?”
“Ah, really, just grab something and do it! Do you want someone like a general to steal your grandson’s weapon?”
“Ah, I don’t know! i don’t do it! If you don’t give it to me, I will never do it!”
Reina, as well as Lewis and Temuran, who were watching from the side, opened their mouths blankly.
“Don’t, then! You’re calling a tired person and making ridiculous arguments!”
As Lian walked towards the entrance of the mansion after retracting the sword, Clump’s eyes turned friendly.
“You’re getting stronger, Rian. You’ve gotten really strong.”
Not obsessing over winning even with a general in front of him means that he has already escaped the yoke of victory and defeat.
“He who realizes what he has does not snoop on what others have.”
“I don’t know the difficult words. Anyway, everyone is fine. We will eat and leave right away.”
Rayna was taken aback.
“Tonight? Aren’t you sleeping?”
“I’ll sleep in the carriage. Leaving right now doesn’t mean the world will change… … .”
It was the secret of time that Sirone taught me.
“The enemies are also on the move. If it’s a race that runs the same time, even one minute is big.”
When Lian sleeps, the enemies sleep, and when Lian fights, the enemies fight.
If so, whoever saves a minute wins.
‘Sirone.’
According to the rumors I heard on my way back to Tormia, it is said that even now it is constantly wandering around the world and eliminating the psychic realm.
‘Perhaps it’s to save one completely unrelated person.’
I couldn’t stay by her side, but this was the only way to relieve Sirone’s burden.
‘Oh, it really doesn’t change.’
I couldn’t even imagine how heavy the burden was on Lian’s shoulders as she returned to the mansion.
‘It was my meal a few years ago.’
He is the youngest brother who can’t find any talent and has a dull personality and is selfish.
‘But I had one.’
Even if a human being named Buddha annihilated the world, Lian would not give up until the very end.
‘Go, my sister.’
Reina held out her palm while looking at her younger sister’s back as they walked away.

[748] The Age of Turbulence (4)
* * *
Gustav Empire.
The Gustav Empire, which divides the world into thirds along with the Kashan and Jincheon empires, was saddened by the emperor’s death.
Black flags flew everywhere in the streets, and no one bared their teeth.
If his smile were to be caught on the competition table, he and his family would be decapitated that day.
Squeezing out crying was a natural skill of the people of the empire, and many people had nightmares about the music heard from door to door.
So Havitz, 16, quietly passed away on a cold starry night at the age of 122.
Officially.
While the whole country is seething with the heat of sadness, there is only one place where the sound of laughter and the joy of pleasure never cease.
It was Arkaba, the easternmost part of the empire, ruled by Havitz XVII, the late son of Havitz XVI.
The official’s expression hardened as he passed through the Grand Hall of the royal castle, Arkaba, and headed for the annex of Havitz XVII.
‘A fact that should never be known. The emperor… … .’
He died of pleasure.
Havitz’s 16-year-old corpse was in a state of glaring eyes, with filth vomited from all the orifices.
The 17 women who were in bed together and the maid who posted the first report were decapitated on the spot.
‘The only remaining bloodline in Gustav, Havitz 17 years old.’
Havitz XVI gave birth to 782 children in 122 years, but all of them were not of this world now.
This is because of the unique inheritance method passed down to the Gustav Imperial Family, and members of the royal family who are over 20 years old receive a kinship killing license.
Any member of the imperial family over the age of 20 can be killed, and if unavoidable, a successor is determined through a special test.
Harvitz 17 also became the final successor by brutally punishing 17 members of the royal family four years ago.
‘In other words… … .’
He killed 781 of his brothers.
After the death of the emperor, he had to immediately run to the capital and attend the succession ceremony, but still staying here… … .
‘Without any basis, but absolute confidence.’
Anyone who knows the 17-year-old Havitz’s path says this with one voice.
Unanalyzable, unknown existence.
That’s why even the nobles of the empire do not dare to launch a coup d’état.
Upon reaching the huge gate made of gold, the messenger of the capital swallowed dry saliva and took a deep breath.
“… … .”
Moans of pleasure and joy could be heard through the door.
“Your Highness, Darmov, the Minister of Internal Affairs of the capital, wants an audience.”
Instead of answering, I heard the screams of men and women, and as if that was a signal, the guards opened the door.
‘This is beyond imagination.’
The smell of corruption stung my nose first, and 200 men and women were doing beastly acts in a huge space.
The pretty boy and the pretty girl were both beautiful and young, but when they looked at them in bulk, it was as if they were seeing a monster with bizarre things.
“What are you?”
An undressed middle-aged man was sitting on a golden chair, smoking a pipe.
‘The author is… … .’
The King of Desire, Gustav Havitz, 17 years old.
The face was ugly long, the nose was small, but the eyes were beautiful like a woman’s, and they were in perfect harmony.
‘It’s exactly what I heard.’
In this place filled with the air of pleasure, only he was watching the actions of others without doing anything.
Rumor has it that he smokes an asker.
It was a powerful drug that was banned even in the empire because even if it was forcibly blocked for one day, he would commit suicide.
‘But Harvits 17 enjoys askers.’
Smoke 3 grams exactly every 24 hours.
‘The strongest temperance achieves the greatest desire.’
It was a famous saying that spoke of Harvitz’s disposition, and it was the reason he survived among more than 700 siblings.
“The empire mourns the death of the emperor. You have to hold the succession ceremony as soon as possible.”
“it’s bothering. There are no women and no men to strip off, no things to have, no ambitions there. When I want to become emperor, I will visit you, so give it to anyone for the time being.”
Harvits burst out laughing and pointed at Darmov.
“What would you rather do? It wouldn’t be bad to massage the beauty of the empire before dying.”
‘What kind of confidence do you mean?’
Feeling terrified, Darmov hurriedly said.
“I don’t know how to respond to Your Highness’s jokes because the small man is stupid.”
“Puhahahaha!”
Asker’s smoke billowed out of Havitz’s throat as he turned his head and smiled.
Laughter suddenly cuts off.
“As much as we fear pain, we fear pleasure.”
Havitz asked for the smoking pipe again.
“Does your heart race just by imagining great pleasure? Are you afraid that you will lose control, that you will lose yourself?”
I couldn’t breathe as if my airway was blocked.
‘Please, please finish quickly.’
For the first time in his life, Darmov regretted being Minister of the Interior of the Empire.
“My father did.”
Havitz XVI had seen all the sweetness in the world, but there was one thing he couldn’t have.
“Did you say Adrias Miro?”
The successor of Guffin, the best defender of mankind who blocked Heaven’s army with a dimensional barrier.
From the moment he lost sight of her, Havitz, 16, strangled himself with pleasure like a man with an insatiable thirst.
“It’s about losing control. He has no interest in the emperor, but in that respect he is a pathetic human being.”
Since he was a Darmov who assisted the emperor all his life, he had no choice but to open his mouth this time.
“Your Highness, it is not for someone who will receive the title of emperor to make comments that disparage the former emperor… … .”
“No problem.”
Havitz, 17, rose from his chair.
“If this world were to be given a few problems by an author named God and then be rewarded for solving them… … .”
Suddenly, the sword next to the chair was pulled out.
“Everything would have been simple. There is no one to be unfair, and I will not worry about whether I will live like this or that. But I mean,”
Habitz, who came down the stairs, rolled the man and woman lying in front of him with his foot.
“The problem is not even there in the first place. What is this world like… … like a square. We just get together here and do something.”
There is no right answer because there is no problem.
“Whatever you do in there… … .”
Darmov shrugged as the sword pierced the torso of the two as they rolled across the floor and crashed into the ground.
“It means nothing happens.”
The stabbed moaned, but those addicted to askers didn’t even care.
Havitz continued to draw his sword, watched the bloody blade for a moment, then shrugged.
“Okay, I killed someone. What’s your opinion? Do you think I did something bad?”
The blade of the sword touched the nape of Darmov’s neck.
“My, all the subjects of the Empire are the property of Your Highness… … .”
“no no! Not like that! I mean, there’s nothing in the world that shouldn’t be done! It’s not like there’s anything you absolutely have to do. just… … !”
Havitz, who was shaking his head looking for something to say, turned to Darmov and shouted.
“It’s nothing!”
A bloody sword pointed at the corpse.
“Dead! it would be painful So what? what’s happening to me You’re just dead! I just killed him!”
“Huh. Whoops.”
Urine trickled down Darmov’s trousers.
“That’s why it’s interesting, the world now.”
If human emotions become reality and attack us, what form will Havitz’s emotions take?
“I am not interested in the emperor. If you’re here to tell a boring story, I’ll make it fun.”
“castle… … The temple is open.”
Darmov squeezed his voice desperately.
“This is the 420th meeting. Because there is no owner of the empire… … Your Highness must enter the temple… … Whoops!”
Suddenly the knife was withdrawn.
“Hmm, it’s a temple.”
Havitz’s eyelids, which had been closed and thoughtful, trembled, revealing the whites.
“Yes, it’s a much more fun place than the Empire.”
Woorin.
“Ah, I’m really going crazy. This is really unbearable… … .”
After confirming that blood was flowing to Havitz’s center, Darmov slowly backed away.
“Yeah, that’s it. One finger at a time… … pop… … .”
I didn’t even want to think about what I was imagining.
“But that is just interlude entertainment. True desire is not like that. Do you know what I really want to commit, Home Secretary?”
“Me, for me… … .”
“world. everything that exists.”
Grabbing the sword and extending both arms, Havitz’s center of gravity became completely vertical and stood up above his belly button.
‘I’m not human. Even if he is a human being, we must not put him in the category of a human being.’
The new emperor, Gustav Havitz, 17 years old.
“The whole world will be violated.”
A fly I don’t know where it came from was flying across the ceiling.
* * *
Southern Akkadian Desert.
3,000 demons who escaped from the psychic realm gathered here, the epicenter of Northcarta, the equatorial wind called the god of the desert.
“Commander, there is no place to occupy anymore.”
A demonic warrior wearing armor weighing over 1 ton was standing in the direction of the muddy and gloomy voice.
Member of the 4th Corps, 2nd Division Commander, Surga Gasias.
“… … .”
demon.
Although it is used in a bad sense for humans, it was originally a general term for a phenomenon in which a strong collective consciousness was projected.
Humans’ power is distributed among many countries, while the demons’ entire army is united under the name of Satan.
It is called the 72nd Corps directly under Satan.
The extreme fear that occurs when a human dies turns into a demon and flows into the underworld.
The frequency of occurrence of demons is almost equal to the number of deaths left in human history, a figure that clearly shows what kind of life most humans have lived.
And the commander of the 72nd corps uses their fear as food to train an army of over 2 billion in hell.
“What is occupation? It is to look down from a high place on the state of perfect submission.”
In that sense, the 2nd Division under the 4th Corps could not be said to have occupied the southern desert.
“Now I’m going to play the last one left.”
In the end, demons can be said to be a race made of the remnants of information left behind by humans, that is, the soul.
The furnace that melts demons is called a ‘fire plate’, and ‘hellfire’ that melts human souls is always burning here.
When the souls that have fallen into the hellfire are purified, they become one and become a demon, and the ability is determined by the individuality of the combination.
“Let’s go, my faithful men.”
The position of division commander in Satan’s army is equivalent to that of a nation’s commander in terms of human rank.
Although the psychic realm was reduced through the Zion Project, it was like leaving the worst demon in the desert.
“Kill the human! Every time they scream, we will grow stronger. Give them the most terrible death!”
Therefore, humans define Ma in this way.
devil demon.
“This world is ours!”
An army of 3,000 crossed the desert.
The place they were heading to was the dungeon of Zulu, the great wizard of the Kingdom of Paras, and the pyramid where Gaold and Gangnan were hiding.

[749] The Age of Turbulence (5)
* * *
sanctuary.
It is a transnational organization created by the Three Emperors, Chilwangseong, and King Lee.
Founded by Theraje, and built with the cooperation of 24 countries, including the Holy Temple, mankind’s strongest military force.
Now that Heaven’s activities have been quiet, other than the Eternal Community, countries around the world have been voicing their opinions that Valkyrie should be the vanguard against the 72nd Demon Legion.
“Enter Kashan!”
To the national anthem of Kashan played by the Republic of Korea’s military band, Uorin took a step forward.
The guards, divided into geunjungwon, spread out over a wide radius and crossed their eyes like a net.
Behind Uorin, Fengzhang, the strongest swordsman group, moved with the same stride without an error of one centimeter.
‘I thought it was time to get used to it, but… … .’
Gando acted as Wurin’s aide.
‘I don’t get used to it at all.’
The time and location of the holy temple change every time, but as it is a venue for world leaders to show off their national power, it was incomparable to any other summit in terms of scale.
“Welcome the state guest!”
Along the overpass dyed in golden light, the Republic of Korea’s honorary troops turned heavy halberds to greet the Empress.
‘This side is also fully prepared.’
The Seven Kingdoms Republic of Korea is a peninsula that juts out in the shape of a dolphin in the southern part of the Gustaf Empire.
Originally, it should have been eaten by the Empire because there was no contact with other countries except Gustav in the north, but in the end, Cotria defended its territory with the dignified name of the Seven Kings.
‘I must have done my best enough to be proud of myself. But the biggest reason… … .’
This is because he owns the ancient weapon Ex-Machina.
It is presumed to be a type of MAP weapon, and Uorin said that it might not be a power-based weapon, but a legal weapon.
“It’s Gando.”
Wu Lin called quietly.
“Has Sirone not contacted you yet?”
Urin sent a message to Sirone, who has been wandering around the world since becoming Five Star, but he has not received a reply yet.
“That’s right.”
Gando thought for a moment, then added.
“Shall we send someone again?”
If the polite letter was coldly rejected, the empire would have no choice but to resort to coercive means.
“No, it’s okay. You must be busy.”
Uorin’s voice was full of sadness, and that fact surprised Gando.
‘It seems that his coolness is shaking today.’
Wu Lin called again.
“It’s Gando.”
“Yes, Empress. Please tell me.”
“Sit next to me today.”
“yes?”
He had accompanied him to the temple several times, but this was the first time she had offered a seat next to him.
“Gustav’s emperor has changed.”
Gustav Havitz, 17 years old.
According to Mistra’s memories, not Uorin’s, he was an interesting human equal to himself.
‘Now, as a human being, he must have reached his age. What kind of person he would have grown into.’
“Do I deserve it? If you are concerned, should I give Fengzhang a separate instruction?”
Although they were giving all the conveniences of the empress, in terms of combat power, Gando was in the middle of the middle of the royal knights.
“are you okay. Just stay by my side.”
“… … All right.”
If what Uorin was reluctant to do was force, Gando would be the right person.
After the position of the Three Emperors was over, six countries excluding Kotria crossed the gate, showing off their military power.
Paras of the Middle East, Gate of the East, Jive of the Central Continent, Iron of the Southern Continent, Arachne representing the 10 Kingdoms of the Southern Continent, and the Southern Continent.
A country’s position is relative, and it is impossible to calculate a country’s national power with numerical values alone, but no kingdom in the Seven Kingdoms was weaker than Sirone’s hometown, Tormia.
“Lee Goonwang enters!”
Only after all of the human units had gone in did the representatives of the dragons and fairies appear.
Unlike human rulers who reached the pinnacle of ostentation, there were only two.
This is because dragons take pride in being the strongest in any situation, and fairies hate pretending.
“It’s been a while, Apostle of Time.”
Leading a body as big as a house, Enox, the representative of the fairies, greeted the approaching dragon.
1st Class Dragon Blitz.
With a sharp snout like a sword, a sleek body, and blue scales, electricity seemed to flow even when they were still.
“Pterosaur, I didn’t know you would come.”
Although he was the best among the 12 apostles in terms of combat power, he had a dislike of getting involved in politics like this.
“I don’t like it, but I can’t. I have no interest in the temple, but I have an important agenda today.”
“This is an important issue for the Balaur… … Hmm.”
Enox, who had rested his chin on his chin and thought, looked back at Blitz with a big smile.
“Does the sun explode?”
“Not funny at all.”
Enox, who had immediately cooled down, pursed his lips.
“Yes, yes, would a noble one laugh at the jokes of a lowly elf like me? It’s good, because it’s noble.”
“… … .”
Blitz, who had been walking silently for a long time, turned his head roughly in front of the castle gate.
“How come 4,000 years have passed and that damn manic depression hasn’t been cured?”
“Never mind. Should I mix words with a kid like me?”
Fairies have as many emotions as they are pure, and if humans are angry creatures, they have depression.
‘In a sense, I hate it more than humans.’
There are humans who fell in love with and married fairies, but most of them did not end well because of this nature.
“Thank you for coming. Please come in.”
When the minister who was waiting at the gate lowered his head, a big smile appeared on Enox’s face again.
“hello. Is His Highness doing well?”
It was the same when I saw Uorin from a distance, but Enox’s appearance was a beauty different from that of a human.
“Ah yes. You are very healthy.”
When Blitz raised his head, the soldier on the wall stomped his butt in fright.
“Hee!”
“The gate is low.”
Should the dragon bow its head and enter?
“sorry. Apparently, it was adjusted to the height of a human… … .”
It was the first time Blitz participated in the holy war, but I couldn’t bear to say it out of my mouth.
“Hmm… … .”
The sound of bones twisting began to be heard from Blitz’s body, who was looking down at the minister in dissatisfaction.
As Enox frowned, his body gradually compressed into a human form.
It was a reconstruction in a form that only a first-class dragon could do.
“This should work.”
Blade-sharp blue scales replaced her hair, and thunderbolt pupils flashed beneath the protruding eye bones.
“Ah, of course. thank you.”
The trumpeter shouted in time with the music of the military band.
“Igunwang! Entrance!”
The temple was opened.
* * *
An army of 3,000 demons surrounded the Pyramid of Zulu, which stood alone in the land of the dead.
“Go in! Kill everyone you see!”
Every time division commander Gaias wielded a saw blade-like weapon, monsters from the dungeon were being cut to the bone.
“Poor things.”
With no heart, the Zulu simply spat out empty words and raised their hands from the top of the pyramid.
“Erga.”
The darkness of the endless abyss.
A black bird soared into the sky and was crushed with a thud.
Just like Zulu did a long time ago.
Key eh eh eh!
As the black mass crumpled like paper spread over the gigantic body, the 10-meter-tall Shinigami spread thunderbolts.
“Rush! There is no retreat!”
The curtain of lightning shook like a wave, but the demons attacked the pyramid, not caring about the flesh bursting.
“Let’s try, Erga.”
As the lightning faded, the lich raised his hands to the sky, a swirl of demonic smoke.
“The resentment of the dead.”
It was a terrible disaster that only Zulu could implement, death-related magic that those who had life could not use.
“Heo-eok! Huh!”
Gang Nan held two machetes in his hands and wandered through the labyrinth of the pyramid.
‘How many are there?’
Although he occasionally met demons in the desert, it was the first time he faced an army this large.
“die! Pain for humans!”
As the soldiers with prominent blue veins like corpses rushed forward with their spears, Kang Nan threw himself into the blade.
“Yaaaaap!”
As he shook his shoulder violently and swung his machete, the enemies’ necks fell off.
“Rabe! Naberaum!”
In the gap between the demons who had opened up like that, Division Commander Gasias swung a saw blade greatsword.
“Keugh!”
I crossed the machete with an X to block it, but the saw blade pulled and missed the handle.
“You know how to make a woman suffer!”
Gaias pushed in from the shoulder.
“But I only kill!”
“what… … !”
Gangnan, who lost his weapon, twisted his upper body in a posture unique to Ram Muay.
“You’re talking!”
As the powerful high kick hit the ironclad, the heavy body was pushed as if there were wheels underneath and crashed into the wall.
“Commander!”
Gaias shook his head at a shock that was inconceivable to be the power of a human, and that of a woman.
“You can never pass by here!”
Every time Gangnan swung his shin like a whip, the demons’ knees broke and their heads exploded.
“… … is it?”
Cruelty to the demons was as natural as a human being willing to chew a pig to fill their stomachs.
“All troops advance!”
All the demons split left and right in front of the river and started running into the depths of the labyrinth.
“no! there… … !”
When Kang Nan, who had a terrible imagination, shouted with a pale face, Gaias swung his great sword.
“Oohhhh!”
When a saw blade got stuck in the boat, sparks flew in Kang Nan’s eyes.
“Kwaaaang!”
Kang Nan, who made a wolf sound and pulled his stomach in, bit the blade with both elbows and knees.
Ram Muay Striker – Arang’s.
Gaias, glaring at the wolf’s vision, swung his sword and broke the wall.
Kurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
“Big!”
Watching Kang Nan, who had rolled on the floor, hold on to his stomach while lying on his stomach, the jagged greatsword snapped.
‘To break a sword made of hell iron.’
Although they acknowledged her as a warrior, it was the demons who could become cowardly in order to achieve Satan’s purpose.
“I’m sorry, but that’s it.”
Gangnan jumped up.
“Gaold!”
No matter how complex the labyrinth was, with this level of troops, someone would eventually reach the bottom floor.
“Commander! I do!”
Gaold’s door was wide open when Gangnan descended the stairs at the sound of a voice coming from the floor below.
“No eh eh!”
The moment Gang-Nan shouted at the end of the hallway, the ground spurred on and threw his body.
Whoops!
The pyramid rocked up and down unbelievably.
“… … .”
The son-in-law was silent, and only the sound of demons running far upstairs came through the walls.
“uh… … .”
Kang Nan cautiously entered Gaold’s room.
All the demons were crushed with blood cakes, and in the corner was a piece of meat presumed to be Division Commander Gaias.
Looking at them all, Gaold, who was bony to the point where only bones remained, sat in the fixed gaze at last.
“uh… … .”
I wanted to say something, but when I saw Gaold’s face contorted with pain, I was overcome with fear.
“It’s a mutt.”
Gaold raised his hand and saw the nerves in the back of his hand twitch and his fingers tremble like mad.
“if… … .”
He spat out the words with difficulty in a muddy voice, slowly folding his fingers, leaving his index and middle fingers behind.
“Do you have any cigarettes left?”
“Huh!”
Before the hot tears could cover her eyes, Kang Nan burst into Gaold with a tearful face.

[75] Return of the Archmage (2)
Canis brought me a light green robe. She was in front of Arin watching, but Arcane changed her clothes without hesitation.
Arcane, who moved while stepping on the table, was able to catch her breath only after sitting on the chair.
“Whoa, it looks like I’m going to live a little longer.”
“Are you okay, Master?”
Kanis asked anxiously. The pale skin and contrasting dark circles made it known that he was a dark wizard without revealing it.
‘It’s a nice eye. That’s why I made him a disciple.’
On the other hand, Arcane did not like Arin very much. It is clear that he had a talent, seeing that he had black hair and dark eyes, but he had a weak mind and poor judgment.
There was no malice in the pretty face, and the emotions were clearly visible in the large eyes.
From the moment he saw the old man’s naked body, Arcane clicked his tongue at the sight of her trembling eyes.
‘Tsk tsk, how do you use something like that? It seems useless.’
If it hadn’t been for Canis’ best friend, he wouldn’t have brought such a weak girl.
It was that day 7 years ago.
Unable to move even with life support, he squeezed his last stamina into the capital Baska.
As befits the largest city in the Tormia Kingdom, the streets were rich and splendid. However, on the other side of the light, the miserable lives of those who were abandoned in the city continued.
Ghetto Radum.
As befits a highly polarized capital city, the residents of Radum were living a much more miserable life than the beggars in other cities.
The only way to get food in a place where people don’t even come is to rummage through garbage cans. Even then, the competition was fierce, and it was common to commit murder to eat fish bones.
Arcane found Canis and Arin there.
In Radum, where everyday life is war, the way Kanis, who is only ten years old, survived with Arin was to be cruel.
Kanis’s eyes were burning with hostility towards the world.
Arcane liked that look. Then he brought the two to the dungeon and taught them dark magic.
‘My eyes weren’t wrong. That must be a thing.’
Arcane refused Canis’ support and stood up. Since it was a day to escape from the dreaded aging, he didn’t want to appear weak today.
“Keep an eye on the greatness of the Dark Magic.”
Arcane held the black crystal and closed his eyes. Her hands trembled from her weakness, but her face was filled with excitement that could not be concealed.
“Big!”
As he cheered up, the crystal became soft and wrapped around Arcane like a stream of water. Then, like a dark cloud, it scattered and covered the whole body.
“Quaaaaaaaa!”
Arcane let out a monstrous scream. He absorbed the power he had accumulated for 40 years at once, so if he was an ordinary person, he would have already gone mad.
The concept of dark magic is absorption and assimilation.
Arcane regained his former power by assimilating the dark power absorbed into the crystal into his own darkness.
“Oohhh!”
The shadow cast under Arcane’s feet blazed like flames, then separated from the main body and scattered like fragments.
how much time has passed
Canis and Arin slowly opened their closed eyes. In Arcane’s appearance, I couldn’t find the slightest hint of old age.
It wasn’t that he looked younger or that his waist was straightened. However, her complexion was flushed and her eyes were full of vitality.
Sensing an unapproachable aura from her master who had regained her health, Canis trembled with emotion.
‘Is this the true face of Master? I’ve heard rumors, but it’s really amazing.’
Arcane smiled as if satisfied. It was as strong as it was before being defeated by Alpheas.
“let’s go. From today, the history of Arcane will be rewritten.”
Arcane, who had been waiting for this day for 40 years, left the dungeon without even having time to feel the afterglow of the rushing power.
* * *
The place where Arcane arrived was Baska’s western prison ‘Inferno’. As it is a place where serious criminals between Class D and Class B are imprisoned, he boasted impenetrable security.
“stop! Who are you! This is a controlled access area!”
The guards did not respond carelessly even to the elderly and children approaching. He first drew his weapon and shouted vigilantly.
“Reveal your identity! If you do not comply, I will arrest you!”
“The new blue kids… … .”
A shadow stretched from Arcane’s feet and merged with the shadows of the guards. Unaware of what had happened, the guards rolled their eyes and their eyelids trembled. Then he fell to his knees and fell to the floor.
“Hey, it’s not even a snack. Canis, open the door.”
Canis took a keychain from the guard’s waist and opened the front door of Inferno. He is a master who can crumple an iron gate if he wants to, but he doesn’t seem to have any intention of making things big.
However, Canis’ expectations were immediately missed. From the moment he broke through the main gate, Arcane began to reveal his true colors.
“It’s an intruder! attack! Killing is permitted!”
“Contact the castle and ask for support! A wizard!”
The guards came rushing in with weapons. But to the Dark Wizard, numbers didn’t matter. Arcane’s shadow extended like tentacles and merged with the soldiers’ shadows.
“Ouch! What’s this?”
“I can’t move!”
The guards couldn’t move their bodies. Then, when Arcane swung his hand, he turned to his comrades and began stabbing the spear against his will.
“Aww! it’s crazy? It’s dangerous!”
“I don’t know either! It’s not me!”
Arin’s face turned pale. Born with eyes completely different from those of others, she accepted the fears of the guards without filtering them.
“Kanis, you never said Master would come to a place like this.”
Canis wondered as well. However, his trust in Arcane did not waver in the slightest.
“What are you thinking? Let’s go.”
Arcane slowly broke through the battlefield and headed for the building. When the shadows connected to the guards were suddenly cut off, those who were brawling collapsed with bubbles.
It was mind control, a characteristic of dark magic.
Darkness unites with other darkness. It is to use such characteristics to infiltrate the shadows of others and control their bodies and thoughts.
Looking at the advantages, the nature of dark magic itself was overpowered.
Nevertheless, the reason why it is considered non-mainstream is that one disadvantage covers all the advantages.
It was just that it was weak against light.
In a state where the sun is up, darkness can only exist as a span of shadow. In addition, the stronger the light, the more mental power must be consumed to cast dark magic.
Of course, at night, the dark mage’s capabilities are maximized, but even that was on the verge of losing its light as the photonization theory developed by a genius named Kergos became popular.
There were almost no students who majored in dark magic even in the continent’s magic schools, so it was possible to know how neglected dark magic was in the wizarding society.
However, Canis knew that Arcane had perfectly overcome the disadvantages of dark magic. And the strongest essence he realized was passed on to himself.
‘Yes, you must trust Master. The one who gave me everything.’
After breaking down the entrance and entering the prison, Arcane took care of additional guards in the hallway. Then, they opened the iron door of building A-3, where the prisoners were imprisoned, and entered. Sensing that the incident had already occurred, the prisoners pounded the bars with rice bowls.
“hey! I don’t know who it is, but take it out!”
“hey! Open this damn iron door! Cases are not enough! Or I could kill someone else instead!”
Arcane slowly held out both hands. The grim surroundings of the prison were the perfect place for Arcanes to show off their talents.
“The Power of Darkness.”
The shadows cast in the hallway changed into the shape of a hand and then came out three-dimensionally. Hundreds of hands gripped the barbed wire and yanked it, and the twisting sound of the iron could be heard. The moment the frightened prisoners retreated to the wall, the bars were ripped out in order along the corridor.
bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!
The Power of Darkness was a magic that used the shadows that absorbed the surrounding energy like limbs. A single shadow could only lift a pebble, but hundreds of pairs of hands could easily pull out even an iron bar.
The iron gate opened and after a while, the prisoners showed their bizarre appearance. A heavy iron ball was attached to his ankle.
“What are you, a wizard? It’s so crazy.”
“Anyway, thank you. Let’s say Tongseong. I am Crown, the night cat. On this floor, if you hear your name, they will recognize you.”
Arcane felt the pathetic energy of the prisoners and put on a displeased expression. Even 40 years ago, Inferno was not like this. How did a place that was full of all kinds of heinous criminals end up like this?
‘Time is so free. Does that mean that my life has improved?’
According to Arcane’s theory, the quality of criminals decreases as civilization develops. This is because there are more scammers who know how to roll their hair, and real bad guys infiltrate society.
“Poor things. Does the criminal introduce himself? Do you think you can get out of here just because the bars are gone?”
“What, is this old man senile? I tried to get over it as best I could, but do you know who I am?”
The prisoners stretched out, trusting their superiority in numbers. There is no guarantee that they are on the same side just because they went to prison together.
“Listen up, you fools. If you don’t have the confidence to defeat me, just stay in prison. If you disobey my order, you will suffer the pain of breaking your bones.”
The prisoners burst into laughter.
“Puhahaha! What are you talking about, old man? We’ve come this far, do you think we’ll go back smoothly?”
“Let’s step on it! I need to get out of this damn prison!”
In the excitement of regaining freedom, the prisoners rushed at them without hesitation. But they soon realized that their ankles were still shackled.
Was it paralyzed for a while? Maybe I wasn’t aware of it because I had been wearing it for years.
“uh? uh? Holy shit!”
The prisoners then began to panic. Arcane watched their chatter and snorted at him.
If you chose to be evil as an old man, you must have skills, and if you do not have skills, you must have good brains. However, they were just parasites who ate food in prison.
“The Power of Darkness.”
“Uh, ah! what’s this!”
The hands that had tore off the bars this time wrapped around the prisoners and dragged them into the darkness. Their eyes, noses, and mouths disappeared into a black veil as if they were buried in a giant gel.
After a while, the sound of bones breaking was heard.
“Ugh! Ugh!”
“Turn it off!”
The silenced prisoners could not even scream.
Arin, who heard the eerie sound, spoke to Canis with a shudder.
“Canis, do you really have to do this to get revenge?”
“Arin, denying Master is denying us.”
“Even though… … .”
“Have you forgotten what happened in Radum? There have been many worse things than this. Besides, the prisoners here are the same ones that plagued us in Radum.”
“But you promised. To forget everything that happened in Radum. I will be happy from now on.”
“Nothing is over yet. If Master’s grudge is not resolved, happiness will not come to us either.”
As the darkness that filled the corridors disappeared, prisoners with broken bones were lying on their backs in grotesque positions.
Arcane, who looked down at them with arrogant eyes, murmured.
“Frail things. Was it a worthless step? Or would you feel better if you go to another room?”
The number of criminals imprisoned in Inferno is 320. Perhaps it was only here that low-level people gathered.

[750] Crusade (1)
Tormia Kingdom.
If you go down south from Baska, the capital, you will find the Mapal area, known for its mining area.
It is an important area enough to account for 45 percent of the kingdom’s iron ore production, but it is relatively underdeveloped.
In other words, it meant that the damage suffered by the demons was the most severe, and hundreds of war orphans were suffering from severe starvation in Mapal.
“Here, here.”
There was a small hut where the workers lived and slept in the place where the tunnel collapsed and turned into an abandoned mine.
When the seven children of Dorkin Orphanage opened the door, a haggard woman with loose hair was waiting.
“You are here.”
Now he wanders the world without a place to lean on, but he was once a spectacle of Radum’s spectrum.
Flower Tribe Flarino.
A powerful shock hit her mind when the ancient weapon ‘Flower of Life’ broke, but she survived in the end.
The position of head of Radum was an enemy of the kingdom, and the place where he hid like that was the abandoned mine in Mapal.
“hi? Are you hungry? eat this.”
The children from the orphanage wrapped the leftovers in a cloth and handed them over.
Florino, who hastily stuffed his stomach with food, felt the eyes of the children and lowered his head.
“You always take care of me like this, thank you.”
Extreme passivity made it impossible for even children to treat it carelessly, and it was strange to them.
“are you okay. Our orphanage puppies also eat it.”
The illusion that if you are just beautiful and obey the master’s words, they will also give their lives to protect you.
That illusion that only flowers can make was the biggest failure of the clan.
“By the way, what are we going to do now?”
“Let’s play tag. Flarino, you find us.”
Still, the children were innocent, so Flalino deserved to stay here for a long time.
“yes. Then I will find it.”
Just as the children were about to leave the cabin holding Flallino’s hand, the door opened and a boy one head taller than his peers entered.
“Hey, you guys!”
You can enter the orphanage until the age of twelve, but his face looks good enough to be sixteen.
It was common to lie about one’s age, and Dorkin needed someone to control the children.
“Ugh! what, what?”
Even though he knew about the incident in the cabin, he didn’t care, so he didn’t know why he suddenly looked like a goblin.
“Follow me all. Director, take that woman for a long time.”
Dorkin Orphanage.
The altar was opened and the orphanage was newly established, and the director was a man named Dorkin who was over 60 years old.
‘Kids are truly awful.’
Having gone through all of the childbirth struggles, the reason he dared to establish an orphanage was because of the subsidy from the kingdom.
‘But it’s salty.’
Success comes from a crisis.
“Director, I brought her.”
According to rumors, he is a little short of his head, so he does everything the children ask him to do.
Dorkin, who thought that the children were also a little short-sighted, let go, but the sixteen-year-old’s report was not something to be taken lightly.
“Do you want to ask me to come in?”
When I said this in a benevolent voice, the door opened and Flallino walked away with an awkward expression.
“Hoo?”
Dorkin’s eyes changed at once.
If she was just an idiot, she would have put her in an orphanage and had her do chores, but even among aristocrats, such beauty was extremely rare.
‘Is the woman selling her body crazy?’
He stood up from his seat as he watched Flallino, who was looking down in terror.
“So, you stole food from our orphanage?”
To be precise, it was dog food.
“yes. Thank you for your help.”
Dorkin also raised his hand, revealing the emotions he had been hiding.
“Then you know what to do.”
“… … .”
Flallino had no choice but to accept his new master, but suddenly there was a commotion outside.
“What, what is it, mister!”
The moment he saw the face of the man entering through the door, Flallino’s shoulders trembled.
The shock of the time when the flower was broken came to mind.
“Uh, what do you think?”
It was Lufist, the president of the Tormia Magic Association.
“How do you feel? I knew where you were and what you were doing from the start.”
I just held my breath for a moment to avoid the attention of the ivory tower.
“The seed of the flower, where did you put it? Have you already planted them?”
It was fear like a nemesis to Flallino, and when she slipped back, Dorkin stepped up.
“Hey, what are you? Can this woman be a pillar?”
It was a perfect situation to misunderstand, even when I listened to the conversation, as well as the impression engraved with scars.
“You are shutting up. I will take this woman.”
Dorkin, who once dominated the back alleys, could not hand over the woman meekly.
“Do you see what the young blue crab is talking about? do you know where this is? Designate a kingdom directly supported by the capital… … !”
Lufist slapped the back of his hand, and Dorkin’s head slammed into the wall with a bang.
“Aww… … !”
Lufist, lightly ignoring the shivering old man, strode toward Flallino.
“me… … Are you here to kill me?”
“Kill? Why kill a talented person like you?”
In order for the project in Yongleo to be successful, it was better to have as many fire tribes as possible.
“Give me the seed of a flower. If you follow the instructions obediently, I will guarantee your safety as the head of the Magic Association.”
Dorkin turned his head, forgetting the pain.
“Eh, the head of the Magic Association?”
It was surprising that the head of the Magic Association had come to such a crumbling town, but the fact that the reason was because of a woman was shocking.
‘Who the hell is that woman?’
Flallino said with a trembling chin.
“anyway… … Going to break it again… … .”
To her, Rufist was fear itself.
“I will gather the fire tribes. We provide a village for you guys to live in. And I have work to do.”
“A thing to do… … ?”
Since it was an unconventional treatment, I thought the price would be miserable, but Rufist spat out unexpected words.
“I’m going to build a flower garden.”
Of course, what would be planted there would not be beautiful flowers, but ancient weapons made of steel.
“… … .”
“think carefully. is an alliance It’s probably the only chance and last chance for you Hwajok to survive.”
No answer came back, but Rufist, who read Flalino’s eyes, turned around.
“Follow me. We are going to the capital.”
As the two headed for the door, Dorkin hurriedly stood up.
“I-over there… … president of the association.”
If today’s work entered the upper class, the orphanage would be closed that day, and he was bound for prison.
Rufist said in front of the door.
“It is a sensitive situation. I don’t know what kind of scum you are, but don’t be too mean.”
Dorkin immediately figured out his intentions.
“yes! sorry! It will never happen again.”
I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t disgusting, but Rufist went outside without saying anything more.
‘No organization or person is lacking. They’re trash and criminals now, and they’re not in a position to cover them up.’
According to Lufist’s theory of systems, humans are like machines that operate only when coins are injected.
Even humans like Dorkin provide the labor society demands once money is pumped in.
‘Orphans are also future resources. It’s good to have a minimum device that can be managed.’
Even if it was a contaminated system, it was the situation of the kingdom that it could not be destroyed carelessly as long as money was involved.
‘That guy will never understand.’
Perhaps because the world is heading towards destruction, the face of a man as terrible as an enemy came to mind today.
* * *
“Are you really okay?”
Gangnan, who had been crying for a long time while hugging Gaold, stood up as if he had suddenly remembered it.
“What if it’s not okay? Are you saying you want to die?”
Gaold’s body was still soaked in pain.
“There was no sign of it happening until now… … How were you able to come back?”
“The door is open.”
I couldn’t recall the Undercoder’s memories, but after returning to reality, there was information that my senses told me.
Perhaps it went on endlessly, and finally crossed the boundary of the dead and entered hell.
Just in the heat of pain, while countless souls around me melted into the fire of hell… … .
“I just kept walking.”
Gaold’s soul, which had a foot in his life, never melted, and endured only eternal pain.
“Then I opened the door and came out.”
As the altar opened, the psychic realm was created, and for Gaold, that point was the end of hell.
“Is that what you want to do now?”
Even though he had a journey that he could not even dare to imagine, Kang Nan was rather absurd in his calm tone.
“But it is true.”
Gaold took a deep breath and rubbed the wick with his fingers to blow it out.
“You don’t have to suffer.”
“Pain… … .”
Gaold, who had been looking down at his fingertips indifferently, looked back at Gangnan.
“The pain has gone up.”
The reason my heart sank the moment I heard it was because it was an unbearable pain even before falling into a deep sleep.
“How, how do you live like that… … .”
Gangnan started to cry again, but Gaold only smiled bitterly.
“Pain is the only proof of life. There is no one in the world who lives as intensely as I do.”
“But in that state… … .”
Just as Kang Nan was about to speak, the screams of the dead reached the lowest level of the pyramid.
“… … Looks like Zulu is done.”
Gaold realized just by hearing the sound, and after a while Zulu entered the room.
“The demons are wiped out.”
Gangnan tried to explain Gaold’s awakening, but Zulu already knew through the vibrations of the pyramid.
“… … You’re back.”
“Thanks to. I owe you this time too.”
“Wandering through hell. It wouldn’t have been a meaningless time for you. What did you bring back?”
What he realized through the hardships that humans can’t imagine, is it really Nane or Sirone?
“There is nothing special.”
Gaold clasped his palm.
“It just got stronger.”
Zulu nodded, pulling up a chair and sitting next to Gaold’s bed.
“Then you will have to decide where to use that strength.”
Zulu calmly recited the story of Gaold after he fell into a deep sleep.
Gaold was unresponsive, but his eyebrows twitched when he heard about the Shion Project.
“It is Chaos. Nothing is fixed, only mutual beliefs collide.”
“You are right.”
Gangnan’s eyes fluttered at Gaold’s words.
“If not one person can disappear without leaving, it can be said that this world has a true happy ending.”
There is no one to feel resentment, and there is no emotion to feel resentment.
“Then you can go to me.”
Gaold was by far the most suffering person in the universe, so it was only natural that he agreed with Nane’s thoughts.
“but… … Mr. Miro is standing up to me.”
Gaold’s face contorted.
‘Obsession.’
I walked endlessly through the fires of hell, knowing that if I just closed my eyes, I would be freed from the pain.
‘I am the salvation.’
In the end, empty space, where everyone would disappear, was the only way for Gaold to break the chain of obsession.
“ha… … .”
A cowardly, arrogant, foolish woman who knows a man’s heart like shit.
“Heh. Hehehehe.”
The more I thought about it, the more pathetic I burst out laughing.
“I’m going to really go crazy.”
Having made his decision, Gaold raised his head.
“Is it okay if I step on a guy named me?”
Zulu and Gangnan did not answer, but they knew there would be no change.
Gaold’s heart was also bigger than the universe.

[751] The Temple (2)
* * *
sanctuary.
It was quite bizarre to see the 12 world leaders gathered in one place.
A single word from them would shake the world, and the agenda agreed upon here would cause a huge change in the earth’s crust.
President Vasari of the Republic of Korea, the site of the temple, is sitting in the chairman’s seat, but the overall composition is that the Seven Kings are on the side of the Three Emperors while King Lee plays the role of listener.
Uorin, the head of Valkyrie, closed the file.
“Then let’s set the magic bullet supply ratio like this… … .”
She paused for a moment, but pretended to catch her breath and spoke naturally.
“Shall we take a break for 10 minutes?”
No one showed any signs, but the meeting had already been going on for 7 hours.
‘That’s why it’s a problem.’
The only reason Wulin stopped talking was because of 17-year-old Gustav Havits, who was sitting across from the huge round table.
‘How long will you be staring at me?’
Since the temple was opened, Habitz hadn’t opened his mouth even once, and he had been staring at Uorin without even looking away.
It was the same even now after declaring a break, and the motion of sitting crookedly and nodding in a chair was no different from the first time.
‘provocation. No, it’s not like that.’
are analyzing
When I met the gaze that tried to capture every hair in my eyes, I hated to even think about what he was imagining.
“Heh heh, come to think of it… … It’s late to say hello. Congratulations on becoming the new master of the Empire.”
Mayer, the king of Jive, representing the Central Continent, asked Havitz to shake hands.
“… … .”
However, Havitz did not even turn his head and continued to move his chair.
“Hmm, hmm.”
Mayer’s embarrassment was indescribable, and the soldiers of the ‘Shinjang’ of the Jive Guards lined up behind them all put their hands on the handle of the sword equipped on the left side.
“Heh heh, stop that. In a place like this… … .”
Who dared to disrespect the King of Jive, this seat was a temple overflowing with such people.
‘You cheeky child. It was the same position not too long ago.’
Prior to the death of Havits XVI, Havits XVII was only a king who ruled part of the empire.
“By the way, what kind of person was Nane?”
When Moon Ryong, the ruler of the Moon Kingdom, asked, Jin Kang, the emperor of Jincheon, also showed interest.
“I graduated from the Jive Kingdom.”
Mayer put on an embarrassing expression.
“There is no such thing as a person. He was just an international student, and now he has become an enemy of mankind.”
At the attitude of blocking information in advance, the eyes of the heads of the Seven Planets did not look good.
Just this alone made the atmosphere cool, and Uorin met Havitz’s eyes for the first time.
“I want to ask you something.”
Havitz, who still seemed unresponsive, suddenly opened his mouth.
“How long has it been?”
Behind Harvitz, four figures were sitting on the floor in different poses.
“Seven hours and 48 minutes?”
Rather, the questioning woman was on her knees, and her outfit was ridiculous enough to be called a clown.
Her face was powdered white in a cumbersome fancy dress, and her eyes were always big because her eyelids had been cut off.
I drew large eyelashes in black, and there were three lines down and three lines up.
Gustav’s four skills, the battle doll Natasha.
Another highlight of the temple is the unique military standards of the royal guards who protect the kings of each country.
However, Havitz did not accompany the guards and entered and entered the temple only with four generals.
‘They’ve only heard rumors… … .’
Even if they didn’t show it, the eyes of countless people who were paying attention finally went to the back of Havitz.
‘The four skills that the King of Desire commands.’
Although Harvitz was not normal, there were many talented people among those who were led by the world’s best charisma.
Among them, the 4 skills were selected and selected talents, and those who reached the peak in one field.
“Seven hours and 48 minutes… … .”
Havitz muttered in a low voice, finally straightening the chair and resting his chin on the table.
“They say it’s Mitochondrial Eve, but it’s surprisingly impatient, a girl called the Empress of Kashan.”
A strong wind blew through the temple simply by shaking the bodies of 100 wind commanders.
“Stop.”
The wave of air stopped in an instant.
“It’s not really something to bear with. Staring at me like that makes me feel bad.”
Uorin reacted as expected.
“You live with male genes, right?”
It was a fact known to all representatives of the temple, but it was an unwritten rule that could never be uttered.
“How about taking mine?”
Lightning struck Gando’s eyes, but Uorin was not shaken by such an event.
“Your ancestors also made such a suggestion.”
It was a secret file that no one knew about.
“But I turned it down because it wasn’t up to par. Even more, you are inferior to your ancestors… … .”
Harvits yawned.
“It will be fun. I wonder what kind of guy will be born. What if my daughter gives birth to another daughter?”
‘I’m not listening. Is there no trauma?’
I deliberately mentioned my father to stimulate my inferiority complex, but I couldn’t get that feeling at all.
‘Confidence close to madness. It’s the height of narcissism.’
His predecessor, Havitz 16, was a person who was sensible even though he was obsessed with desire.
‘A monster created by the times.’
Wu Lin, who has lived together throughout human history, knows how evil and cruel humans can be.
But the Harvits in front of me now felt like all of them put together.
“Hmm, so I gave birth to 3 daughters, and those 3 gave birth to 3 more… … . No, using her son to get her daughters… … .”
Ignoring Harbitz, who was constantly muttering, Uorin proceeded with the meeting.
“Now, let’s get into the serious agenda. This is the budgeting of each country for Valkyrie operation and altar defense.”
Even if it’s a holy war, it’s an iron rule to promote one’s own interests.
Therefore, it was the norm to bring up sensitive issues like now at a time when everyone is getting tired.
‘It’s a full-scale fight from now on.’
At the time when the representatives strained their eyes to get even a little profit, Havitz shouted.
“That’s right!”
The serious atmosphere suddenly broke.
“It’s food! All you have to do is hang them in clusters and have them give birth to one child a day!”
“You son of a bitch!”
At the same time as Jiandao jumped up, Jinkang, the emperor of Jincheon, hit the table.
Woo woo woo woo woo!
As the heavy table carved from marble trembled terribly, the faces of the five generals representing the Jincheon Empire, Ryongjang Oh, stiffened.
‘father.’
Seong-eum was also acknowledged for fighting against Nane, and entered the temple as a general of the Blue Dragon unit.
“I don’t particularly want to nag the ruler of the world… … .”
The fact that Habitz looked at someone other than Uorin was enough to guess the atmosphere in the hall.
“Why don’t you shut up that rotten snout? Or get rid of the smell of feces from your mouth.”
It seemed like something big was about to happen.
“I mean… … Are you asking me to poop, in your mouth?”
As Yeo-dal, the captain of the Oryongjang, pushed his heavy body forward, the members of the Yellow Dragon unit moved forward, shaking their ironclads.
Jin Kang did not tell Yeo Dal to stop because the moment he stopped, he was pushed back.
“This is the last time you accept the whining about losing your father, my immature king. You will have to choose your words carefully from now on.”
“What if I don’t choose?”
“A place in the Three Emperors World will be given to a dog raised by our people.”
Harvits averted his gaze and sniffed.
“dog? A dog?”
Then he pointed to Jinjiang again.
“you?”
Natasha raised her head and smiled.
“Ahahaha!”
Yeoda put power into his body, and Seongeum cast an etheric wave faster than that, blocking his movement.
‘My lady, why?’
In Yeo-dal’s eyes, he could see a voice biting his lips.
‘It’s a battle between Habits and Uorin. If arrows are aimed at Jincheon for no reason, everything will be overwritten.’
It was a self-evident fact that the three pillars of the Three Emperors, the first to move would be attacked with pincers.
“Representative of Jincheon, thank you for speaking on behalf of a woman who cannot bear to speak.”
Wu Lin paid homage to Jin Kang, walked the alliance structure, and provoked Harbitz in earnest.
“I am of the same opinion. This is an important place that determines the future of the world. If you’re not good at interfering, why don’t you wipe the bottom in the bathroom before you come?”
“A reckless thing!”
An old man with medium hair who was sitting behind Havitz jumped up to the table and tore his jacket.
“Gustav~!”
All of her bony ribs were exposed on her black nipples.
“Havitz!”
Bend over as if convulsing, he raised his eyes and glared at Urin.
Gustav 4th skill, the king of domestic affairs, sumodo.
“I looked at it because it was the same, and you dare to talk like that to the emperor of the Gustav Empire? stuck on one? uh? Shall I sweep it up right away?”
‘What kind of crazy game is this?’
Officials from each country clicked their tongues, but the faces of the chiefs at the round table all looked serious.
‘My king of sumo. The only person who can assist Havitz. Therefore, what Havitz desires is… … .’
It’s a war.
‘Is that so? But if you’re going to wage war against the world, start with… … ,’
Uorin, unable to read anything from Havitz’s expression, quickly changed her mind.
‘It’s not on that level.’
Why do you call Havitz an unknown being?
Why can’t anyone analyze him.
because there is no idea
‘Now I understand.’
Through the third reset, Wulin was able to observe the life of Havitz 17 three times.
As in the lives of others, Havitz killed 781 of his brothers and was always king.
‘But the problem is… … .’
In all the three times he killed 781 brothers, he never killed them in the same way.
‘Chaos.’
A human being with no stereotyped thoughts in his head, only a jumbled mess of emotions.
In this age of chaos, it was only natural that Havitz, the extreme of chaos, would stand out.
“why? Are you hot? Then come on! I’ll kill all the Kashans! I will kill, kill, and kill again until the seed dries up in this land!”
“… … .”
The reason why there is silence in the temple is because a world war really breaks out the moment you strike back here.
Only Jin Kang was upright.
“Do you really think you can win? Against Kashan, Jincheon, and the seven planets, dragons, and fairies here.”
Harvits has no idea.
“huh. Do you think you can win?”
It was just filled with unfounded confidence.
‘Well, in a sense, that’s all.’
If you really believe that you can accomplish something, isn’t it the law that you actually lean that way?
“I will win. So let’s go, war.”
Amidst the tension that even the representatives of the Seven Planets swallowed saliva, Uorin’s head was still cold.
‘Is it an unstoppable flow? If so, invert in the next flag? No, it goes too far at that time.’
It was impossible to accurately predict even Uorin because the base event did not exist from the time of the Great Purification.
so it’s chaos
‘Where are you and what are you doing?’
I just hoped that Sirone had been properly informed.

[752] The Temple (3)
* * *
The Republic of Eamond was divided into north and south 200 years ago and is still fighting fierce wars.
In particular, North Eymond is an extremely closed society under the reign of terror of the dictator Igor.
It is the only country that did not follow the will of the Ivory Tower, and even after the altar was opened, no country knew about the post-mortem process.
‘The whole village is a military base.’
Syrone, who had arrived in North Eymond three days earlier, was heading south along the mountains near the capital.
After departing from the Ivory Tower, he sealed the altars through seven countries, but there was no result in Eamond.
The residents of this place terribly dislike interference from other countries, and showed a fighting spirit, willing to commit suicide attacks when they found strangers.
‘Aren’t you really brainwashed?’
It’s impossible to brainwash more than 20 million people with magic, but looking at them, I even thought of that.
Another problem other than the difficulty of access was that there was no way to use the Terra Force channel after entering North Eamond.
The people trusted no one but Igor, and were not allowed to believe.
‘I have to sleep in the mountain again today.’
All human habitation areas are being used as military installations, so we had no choice but to camp.
‘Material.’
The final evolution of Armand, which accepted the light of Yahweh, was able to embody all the materials that exist in the world.
“Sleeping bags, tableware, toiletries… … .”
As the molecular structures realized by the battery combined with omnipotence, objects appeared in front of Sirone one by one.
Lastly, Sirone, who realized the firewood, murmured as she remembered the light of Yahweh.
“Light it up.”
The firewood suddenly heated up, and a torch came up and delivered warmth.
It’s deep in the mountains, so patrols won’t come, but I didn’t forget to cast a welcome spell in case of an emergency.
“Whoa, I’m tired.”
Sitting with her back leaning against the trunk of a tree, Sirone gazed at the twinkling stars beyond the leaves.
‘… … Where is this?’
Although Sirone has returned from the infinite realm, the question that humans have had since time immemorial has not been resolved.
‘Let’s not think about it for the time being.’
As long as I was holding on, it was time to focus on human affairs.
Sirone took out a letter from her bosom.
‘By the way, looking for a needle in the desert… … .’
To my dear Sirone, it was a letter written in Uorin’s handwriting that began with .
Sirone read it with her eyes.
First of all, congratulations. You have become a star in the ivory tower.
I want to run to you right now and hug you, but I’m sorry I can’t.
It was a phrase that tickled my face no matter how many times I read it.
If it’s my request, I think you’ll listen.
It was a change of attitude like Uori-down.
could you come to me right now? It’s urgent.
Sirone also read this sentence for the first time and thought about it for a long time because he received a lot of help from Urin.
But if there are circumstances where that is not possible, that is, if you cannot meet me for personal reasons… … .
He seemed to be aware of Sirone’s situation, where he shouldn’t add the weight of emotions to anyone.
There is an item I want you to find on your journey to seal the altar.
It’s for humanity.
It doesn’t matter how long it takes, but you must find it.
If it was a request of this kind, Sirone would have been able to grant it.
From now on, I will tell you about the future I predict.
Mitochondrial Eve.
Although there is no sub-event that can be compared with past events, Uorin had another ability called future vision.
Sirone speculates that it is by looking at the timeline, and it appears extremely rarely even in the history of the many Theraze.
It was also the reason why the ancestor, Theraze Mystra, killed numerous daughters and made Uorin his direct descendant.
Just like the north, south, east and west of space, this world will expand in the future with four huge directions.
Sirone examined the cross drawn in an easy-to-understand diagram.
Emptiness and love were written in the north and south, and good and evil were written in the east and west.
I call it ‘The Compass of the Law’.
In the future, all beings will stand at a point where these four directions are combined.
In a world where good and evil were everything, another direction was created to escape up and down.
At the center of the compass of the law is a human being who suffers and suffers endlessly, losing direction.
Mikea Gaold.
If you’re extreme, you’re extreme.
I can predict that you will not come to me because you keep the law of benevolence.
Even if it is not a future time, if you use the compass of the law, you can guess the principle of the world.
In the East, this is called Yin-Yang-do or Juyeok.
And, of course, there is Miro as a representative of the polar line.
Because he inherited the will of Fermi’s mother, Yolgah.
By the time you get the letter now, Miro will have already implemented the Zion Project.
In a word, it lit the torch of good.
Now you know what I want to say.
From this point on, Uorin’s handwriting began to gain strength.
According to the compass of the law, sooner or later… … It is assumed that the atrocities will appear in the present world.
Because good and evil refer to each other.
Even if you and I are close to each other, the confrontation between good and evil is another matter. Even the slightest tilt to either side would swept away countless people who belonged to the compass of the law.
It was going to be a fight between the four pies that divided the law into equal parts, who could eat more.
Shion is already using her capabilities to the fullest.
At this point, I decided that it would be difficult to drive the atrocities, so I came up with a new method.
Sirone took a long breath and read the next sentence.
Use evil to eliminate atrocities.
Even if it was Sirone’s individual, I didn’t feel particularly thrilled because there was no courtship of good or evil to Yahweh.
That’s important from now on.
Once you have it in your head, cut out and destroy this part.
Kindly even drew a perforated line, but Sirone, who uses materials, could restore it at any time.
The letter I am reading now was like that.
The object you need to find is a dagger named <Law Kill>, which is known as an S-class object.
Like the Armand I gave you, it is known as the strongest object among weapons.
Sirone burst out laughing when he saw the underlined ‘I gave it to you’.
Are you thinking like this? Isn’t it normal that such an object should have already been in the hands of a wealthy person?
answer.
Fortunately, that’s not the case.
Maybe this is more difficult, but no one knows where the <law kill> is.
because… … because no one is looking
Since then, Sirone has also been curious.
Then I’ll give you a hint. Once you know what weapon it is, you’ll be able to trace its route.
First of all, <Defense> is a very dangerous weapon. Because that dagger must kill something.
It was an objet that had no choice but to do so.
how do you kill kill by law
For example, if I hold the <Defense> and think of the person I really want to kill and put my strong desire into it, my will will dwell in the dagger.
It was creepy.
That’s it.
Once the will dwells in the dagger, the dagger must kill its target under any circumstance, even against the law.
At first, I didn’t quite understand.
For example, let’s say that I have <Slaughter> and I have the will to kill person A.
The ways are infinite.
Perhaps one day one of my ladies-in-waiting will steal <Dharma Kill>. Then you’ll get hit by a wagon.
A person walking down the street picks up the <Defense> again. Then, he was pickpocketed, and after endlessly changing the law, he finally ended up in the hands of the innkeeper where A was staying.
The owner was cleaning the room while looking at <Law Killing>, but unfortunately he entered the wrong room and entered the room where person A was taking a nap.
As I approached to look at him for a while, A stumbled upon a bottle of alcohol that A dropped last night and fell forward… … .
Sirone turned to the next page.
In the end, <Law Killing> will be stabbed into the heart of person A without an inch of error.
It was the operation of the law that was impossible without every situation being calculated from the beginning.
I’ve read it several times, but I couldn’t help but feel a chill run down my spine whenever I passed this passage.
“It’s crazy.”
It was a word that came out of my head because I knew how objects were made.
who the hell
How powerful is it that such a ridiculous object can appear in the world because it contains the intent to kill?
As if having a conversation beside her, Uolin wrote the answer right away in the letter.
The reason why I dare to ask you to find <Law> is because the original owner of the object is Mirak Minerva, the Ivory Tower’s Odaeseong.
The shock Shirone received at the time was considerable.
When I found out that the star of the ivory tower was the owner of <Law Killing>, I wanted to ask Louver, but after reading the letter, I couldn’t bear to look for her.
It was about 700 years ago that Minerva became known as the Archwitch.
At the time, I was also active as a witch, so I met her a few times.
Of course, it was the experience of the predecessor, and after this point, a huge empire called Kashan was established.
I’m an unhappy person
If Theraze is to the point of being unhappy… … .
She wasn’t a witch to begin with, but maybe she eventually became one.
There are things you can learn by observing human life beyond the lifespan. that in the end it has to be that way.
Because she’s a woman, because she’s beautiful, because she has a mole under her eye, because a certain part of her personality, because the trend of the times is like that.
If reality is nothing more than a number of combinations, in the end, the future just flowed according to the wheel of the law.
Veron of the Council of the Ten Lords has left with the ultimate experiment on this matter, but it is not yet time to confirm the results.
If free will really exists, it should be able to destroy the future.
So now I’ll call it a curse.
Minerva was born that way. She wants to cry for no reason, she wants to bully her, and she wants to drive her into despair.
Since I was 10 years old, I have been entertained by officials from different countries. It must have been a terrible life.
Wu Lin was speechless.
A child without the ability to fight, the humiliation she endured became anger toward humans… … .
That’s what <Defense> was made of.
* * *
Mercury Water Planet Mirak.
The planet, which was directly gifted by Taeseong, was not inhabited and consisted only of water.
A huge full moon filling the sky.
At the center of the great moon that tempted the witch, Minerva sat on her broom, lost in thought.
It was a little girl of ten.
“… … .”
With the moonlight in her eyes, she held out her hand with a thin eye smile.
“I have to wipe my heart with moonlight.”
While caressing the moon like that, she put her hand on her chest and rubbed it down.
“You have to wipe it clean.”
Transparent tears fell into the sea.
“cleanly… … .”
As long as I don’t close the world, the terrible wounds will never heal… … .
“I have to wipe it off.”
Minerva stroked her chest endlessly.

[753] The Temple (4)
* * *
Sirone looked up at the sky.
‘The law.’
The mechanism of <Slaughter>, which had no choice but to die in the end, resembled the fate of Minerva, who had no choice but to become a witch in the end.
‘Can I escape?’
If you choose bread for lunch today, is it a human will or a combination of infinite variables unknown to humans?
‘Even if you think you’re going to eat bread and then suddenly change the menu… … .’
If that is also the function of the law.
‘It’s too huge to be analyzed, so the expression of Uorin’s curse is right.’
Until Veron’s experiment is over.
Soothing her despondent heart with the music of grass insects, Sirone read the end of the letter.
It is estimated that <Law Killing> was given to Minerva around the age of 20.
And that heinous weapon has killed countless people as it roamed the world.
It was truly destructive.
At some point, high-ranking officials from each country got caught up in strange incidents and continued to die.
It was only then that the leaders started to find out the truth, but it was too late. The revenge was completely successful.
There were as many murderers as there were dead people, but the true killer was Minerva.
Isn’t that what revenge is?
Already irreversible, Minerva chose to become a true witch. She caused a cataclysm called ‘The Walking Dead’ that was recorded in history.
An unspeakable number of people died, at which point the human race came close to coming to an end.
Here comes the ivory tower.
Was this also the wheel of the law?
After stopping the walking dead, the ivory tower offers her two options.
To be judged by mankind. Another is to become a resident of the Ivory Tower and work for humanity.
Minerva was the Five Stars of the Human Security Enforcement Department.
At first, Minerva is said to have chosen the first.
He didn’t want to fight for the humans he hated so much.
But there seems to have been a deal of some sort. According to my expectations… … .
It must have been an order from Taeseong.
He probably said that even those who became murderers according to the law of <Slaughter> would not be held guilty.
The first thing that came to Sirone’s mind when he read Wu-rin’s letter was the meeting with Tae-seong.
The Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower can register one object instead of commanding a satellite.
What she said at the time was not just an example, but exactly what happened to Minerva.
Minerva did not destroy <Law Kill>.
Of course it was presented in the ivory tower, but I think it was carried through to the end.
This caused a huge controversy worldwide.
These were the words of a person who lived at that time.
Minerva was taken to the Ivory Tower under the protection of the stars while imprisoned in a wooden prison.
It was a really huge crowd. There were over 20,000 people, and each of them threw stones and cursed at me.
I could imagine their anguish.
The Minerva I saw, just looked calm.
Even when the reporters asked questions, I was just looking at the front in silence.
Then a reporter broke through the crowd and reached Minerva.
The audience became quiet in an instant, and the question posed by the reporter was… … .
the biggest issue.
Why didn’t you destroy <Defense>?
And Minerva is said to have looked back at the reporter for the first and last time and said:
-Because if someone truly needs to be killed, he has to die.
It was a wish that a 10-year-old girl with no strength or background must have engraved in her heart while being humiliated by countless adults.
That’s how <Defense> is still roaming the world and taking lives.
Now you understand what it means to do evil with evil.
If you find <Law Killing> and put your earnest desire into it, the law will move to remove the atrocities.
actually… … I didn’t say this to sympathize with Minerva. Of course, you would have already forgiven me.
What I want to say is, I think the core of <Slaughter> is the person you really have to kill, that is, the earnestness.
If you’re not desperate, <Defense> won’t activate.
The categories are now narrowed down.
Those in power and wealth only grasp the location of <Law Killing>, and never try to get their hands on it.
If it came into your own hands, you’d have to suspect that someone triggered it to kill you.
A weapon that is like the nemesis of power.
In most cases where deaths are caused by <Slaughter>, it is when the weak kill the strong.
If you trace the route of this case and figure out the movement, you will be able to see where it is and whose hands it is now.
It was here, the Republic of North Eymond, that he reached by quickly tracing the world.
If extreme goodness exists in the real world, the extreme evil must surely exist in the other world. maybe it’s satan
And he’s out of the law like you. That’s why even Anker couldn’t use his hand.
If Nane and Miro follow the law, Sirone and Satan are perfectly balanced towards denying the law.
However, according to Heaven’s report, Satan must also pass through the body of a creature in order to materialize.
At the time, he was a man named Frankwine.
It’s a race against time.
Perhaps Satan is looking for numerous candidates. Too many to sift through with your history search abilities.
That’s why you need <Defense>.
Uorin intended to use <Law Kill> to eliminate all those whom Satan had marked.
I know it’s difficult, but I really want your help.
If you help me with this, you won’t owe me any more.
It was a Uori-like bill to do my best.
I miss you.
The letter ended with Theraze’s seal, and Sirone threw the paper into the bonfire.
There was firm determination in Sirone’s eyes as he stared at the paper that was turning to ashes.
‘Until now, we have been tracking and checking the records of death cases. If my predictions are correct… … .’
It should be here, at the 48th Military Facility, two kilometers from the capital of the North Eymond Republic.
‘We can meet tomorrow.’
Unhappy someone who has <Defense>.
* * *
The second morning in the temple was bright.
The previous day’s talks ended with Gustav’s defeat, and additional talks were held according to a majority vote.
Gustav was planning a world war, and the representatives of each country were unable to sleep to prevent their solo run.
“Then, let’s start the second meeting, which is unprecedented.”
When Uorin declared, the delegates sat down at the round table, and the guards showed more viciousness than before and headed to the back.
“I’m sorry about yesterday. Coming to such a wonderful place seems to have revived the passion of childhood.”
While Gustav 4th class, Sumodo, the king of domestic affairs, was on his way to his seat, he bowed his head toward the round table.
It was an unexpected situation, but this too must have been a cunning ruse from Sumodo’s head.
“We were excited about each other. Let’s finish yesterday’s work with yesterday, and let’s have a more constructive conversation today.”
“As expected, the queen of the empire is benevolent.”
The other 4 arts were already sitting in the seat where Sumodo headed with a servile smile.
Natasha was on her knees, her eyes wide open, and next to her was a middle-aged man in a cross-legged position with his chin resting.
Now, Uorin openly explored them.
‘Gustav 4 skills, God of War Vulcan.’
He grew a beard like a bandit and boasted a muscular body even at the age of 50.
But what was really scary was his brain.
‘The continent’s genius military with both literary and martial arts. It is not an exaggeration to say that Havitz is fighting a war because of the author.’
Vulcan, who met Uorin’s eyes, smiled grinning, baring his teeth without loosening his chin.
‘I have no intention of giving up.’
Today’s meeting will not be smooth, and now all that remains is the choice of other countries against Gustav.
‘World War should be prevented as much as possible. But if you cross the line over there, you don’t have to go too low.’
Guidelines had already been established through secret channels with Jincheon and the heads of the Seven Planets.
“Then I will announce the agenda first. Of course, we were discussing the Valkyrie budget yesterday, but there are issues that need to be dealt with more quickly than that.”
While everyone was silently approving, Uorin glared directly at Harbitz and said.
“so… … Are you really going to have a fight?”
It was a preemptive strike to suppress the steamship, but Harvits was also Harvits.
“You said you would. Didn’t we talk last night? Or what, did you even ask for help?”
However, Uorin had already figured it out.
“You can guess how many people will die. Gustav will not be safe either.”
“are you okay. Because I am not dying.”
In the face of the powerful narcissism that sustains Havitz, Uorin chose to stall.
“Then, Gustaf’s forces, currently belonging to Valkyrie, will be absorbed by the remaining countries.”
“Hmm.”
Sumodo, the king of domestic affairs, rubbed his chin for the first time, and Vulcan, the god of war, nodded with a meaningful smile.
It would have been a choice Havitz 17 would never have made, but the previous emperor, Havitz 16, had invested considerably in Valkyrie to prevent a war with Heaven.
‘If you give up Valkyrie, the power of the Empire will be weakened by 1/17. It’s a world war in this state. The tax increase rate that is stably covered by time, manpower, and materials is… … .’
While Sumodo’s thoughts were spinning terrifyingly fast, Harbitz spoke plainly.
“Then take it. What can I do without Valkyrie?”
The temple was in shock.
Even Blitz and Enox, who were watching the human Baktu with interest, turned their heads with puzzled expressions.
“Are you serious?”
When I analyzed it objectively, I thought that if I pushed to this point, Gustav would have no choice but to step back right away.
Kashan’s analysts stayed up all night and found that Gustav’s win rate was under 10 percent.
“If we gather in the plaza… … .”
said Harvits annoyed.
“Aren’t you supposed to do something? They say that if you just decide all day, the sun goes down. I have to go home. I just want to do something quickly. So, let’s not waste time and start a war.”
Not even considering calculations, just a desire to mess around in my head.
Vulcan shook his shoulders.
“Hehe, as expected, Your Highness. You are an excellent judge. Anyway, it’s killing people, but you have to jump out even while eating.”
Woorin’s eyes calmed down.
‘Did I say it was a square?’
Uorin was also one of the people who stayed the longest in this huge plaza.
‘A person waiting for an appointment, a person reading a book, a person watching people in the square.’
But sometimes there are people like this.
‘A person who creates chaos only for his own pleasure, regardless of what others think.’
Havitz said like a child.
“I want to have fun.”
“… … .”
While the representatives of each country were fed up, he stood up and took hold of the round table.
“Have you not decided yet? Then I’ll tidy it up. From now on, the Gustav Empire… … . Whoops!”
Havitz gave as much strength as he could, but the heavy round table did not budge.
“Heh heh heh! I’m sorry, Your Highness. You should do these fun things with me.”
Vulcan came next to Havitz and grabbed the round table.
“From now on!”
The two exchanged glances and nodded, raising both arms wide at the same time.
“War!”
The round table rotated at a height of 10 meters with the force of the Vulcan, and Natasha raised her head and burst out laughing.
I could see the distorted faces of the representatives of each country beyond the round table that was spinning and falling.
“Let’s kill hotly!”
The moment the round table in the temple was smashed with a thump, Uorin’s eyes turned to life for the first time.
‘It’s atrocious.’

[754] The Doctrine of Evil (1)
The 48th Military Facility was a place where special experiments were carried out under the direction of President Igor.
As such, the most elite agents were stationed there, and the commander was also a captain-level person directly elected by the capital, Pacia.
widely! widely! widely! widely!
With sabers hung from their belt loops and studded boots, people were terrified as they patrolled.
“you! Come on!”
“Me, me?”
When the soldier’s eyes turned to life, a man who was walking on the road hurriedly ran up.
Upon arrival, the soldier’s fist struck the man.
“Ugh!”
The man who was beaten to the ground without even knowing why did not have the courage to look up at them.
“Are there any stupid children like this? Don’t you pay your respects to President Igor even after seeing us patrolling hard?”
North Eymond’s Military Code contains no such provision, but there are over 300 provisions stating that the soldier is the law.
There must have been something unpleasant, and if he resisted here, he would be mercilessly decapitated by the sword.
“sorry! Long live President Igor!”
The man who jumped up raised his arms to the northern sky where the longbow was located.
“… … Go see.”
When the soldier spoke with cold eyes, the man hurried away, feeling fortunate that his neck was still attached.
The partner who was watching from the side asked.
“Why is the pressure so low today?”
“not really. The kids have lost their burrs. Ever since the altar was opened. How can the discipline of a country stand like this?”
“Is the collection not going well?”
The 80 soldiers stationed at the 48th Military Facility were receiving a kind of labor fee from the 1,200 citizens of the city.
“They said they were sick these days. My daughter is sick or something. I’m putting it off every day.”
“ha ha ha! I got caught so badly. Well, when a child is sick, parents turn a blind eye.”
“It’s nothing to laugh about. I have to send money back home, and I’ve spent too much at the bar this month.”
said the partner with a wink.
“Shall I accept it?”
“Is there any way? Even if I hit and break it, it didn’t come out. Doesn’t the commander hate it when strange rumors spread around our flag?”
“This is why jjambab is scary.”
The partner waved a finger and pointed to the residents’ quarters.
“Even if your daughter is sick, isn’t it better than dying?”
Verdi, a 12-year-old girl living as a citizen of the North Eymond Republic, was resentful of the world.
‘why… … .’
Even though he didn’t know exactly what happiness was, he was certain that he was unhappy.
Even in the middle of a fever, she had to cook food for the soldiers who had invaded from the morning.
“So you’d better think carefully. You don’t need to catch a child, do you?”
The soldiers were angry because they couldn’t collect the money, and Verdi was miserable that his mother was beaten because of him.
‘You can’t be sick. I have to endure it.’
I heard a knock on the table, followed immediately by my mother’s tearing screams.
“Is this a joke! Do you really want to know when you see the end?”
I wanted to tell him to run out and give me all the money I hid, but nothing changed anyway.
“please! Not my daughter!”
“Don’t go away! Can you still say that you are a great citizen of North Eymond!”
The hand cutting the carrots became faster and hit the chopping board with a bang.
It was a dagger he had picked up in the mountains a month ago.
“… … I want to kill you.”
<Law killing> was activated.
‘Is it suddenly quiet?’
The thought was only fleeting, and soon the floor became noisy and the soldier’s partner came in.
“hey! I’m going to die of hunger! When will it end?”
“Wait a little. It will be soon.”
Verdi, who hurriedly placed the onion on the cutting board, cut his fingertips while slicing it quickly.
“ouch!”
As I cried at the blood leaking from my fingers, my partner kicked me.
“This stupid thing!”
After knocking Verdi to the floor, he checked the onion and frowned.
“Where is the blood of being sick?”
There were bits of flesh and blood on the chopping board.
But what caught his attention was a dagger lying next to the chopping board.
“what? this… … .”
It had a simple and simple shape, but it was as clean as new, and it was unusual that it had a purple sheen when exposed to the sun.
“what’s the matter?”
A soldier entered the kitchen.
“Look at this. I was hiding something like this. Anyway, all the things that make you sick are the same.”
My partner asked as if thinking about it.
“How’s the harp?”
“It is resolved. He said he brought the money now. It’s going to be like this right away, because I’m just earning money for nothing.”
“Hey, that’s why I told you to trust me. A pack of cigarettes?”
My partner reached into the basket and tossed a potato.
“It’s not good to cook here. Let’s eat this and wake up.”
Seeing that the potatoes had sprouted, the soldier quickly threw them back with a snap of his wrist.
“I won’t eat it even if I give it to you. Eat yourself.”
As the potatoes clung to his hands, his partner thought it was funny and made an offer.
“Then how about this? The person who loses by playing catch will eat it. And a pack of cigarettes.”
The soldier took a position to receive and said.
“However much. Throw it.”
“Okay, let’s go!”
The moment when you take a posture like a player and throw potatoes with a smooth connecting motion.
‘what?’
Partner realized.
‘Wait a minute, am I right-handed?’
Potatoes were received with the left hand.
“What were you holding in your right hand?”
Because he was immersed in his thoughts, the dagger left his hand in a full swing and landed right between the soldier’s forehead.
“Ouch!”
Verdi covered his face and screamed.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
When the partner checked the soldier’s condition, he was dead instantly with his eyes half bulging out.
“Oh, no. I didn’t do it!”
He ran to Verdi.
“You saw it too! We were fooling around! Why did I take the potato with my left hand? Right-handed, I mean!”
Of course, he was holding a dagger in his right hand.
“Mole, I don’t know! I don’t know anything!”
I really don’t know, but the reason I shouted exaggeratedly was because of the guilt that remained in my unconscious.
“Verdi! what’s the matter? Aaaaaaaagh!”
The mother, who found a dead body at the entrance, threw the bundle and fell asleep.
“Sah, I killed a person!”
“You fool! That’s not it! This is an accident! Why would I kill this bastard!”
The partner, who had been strongly denying it, suddenly opened his eyes and pulled out the dagger stuck in the soldier’s forehead.
“Yeah, yes! you killed it! Just do what you killed!”
When I held out the dagger, my mother horrified and stepped back.
“As if you killed me! I’ll take care of the back! If this is reported to the superiors, I’m done!”
It was the words of someone who threatened to kill her daughter, so she only shook her head.
“Just listen to me!”
Frustrated, I took a step forward, but the fallen soldier’s palm was stepped on.
My partner’s heart sank at the soft feeling as if he was tearing through the soles of his boots.
“Ugh!”
Just as I was about to stumble forward as my step foot resurfaced, an insight crept into me.
‘Never die!’
I realized something from instinct, not reason.
“Huh!”
However, the moment I saw the soldier’s eyes, my body stiffened again and sprained my ankle.
‘My, I didn’t kill you!’
He twisted his body sideways, but his limbs were already stiff and he fell to the floor with his whole body floating.
“Ouch!”
The dagger plunged deep into the nape of his neck as he fell with his arms bent.
“Kkeuk. gurgling… … .”
Seeing her eyes wide open with blood boiling from her neck, her mother teared her hair and sobbed.
“Aaaaa! Aaaaa!”
… … This is <law killing>.
A keen-eyed crime expert will note the corpse’s unnatural posture, but in the end, no evidence is left behind.
“Why is this happening to us? What should I do now… … .”
Even calling it a coincidence made no sense, so it was natural for them to panic.
“I killed… … .”
Strangely enough, however, Verdi’s heart was rather calm when the object of fear had disappeared.
“What do you mean, dear? These people died in an accident.”
“No, Mom. To be precise… … .”
Approaching his partner’s corpse with a bewildered face, Verdi snatched the dagger from his hand.
“you you… … .”
Verdi raised the corners of his trembling lips and looked back at his mother.
“This knife granted my wish.”
“Are you crazy? At times like this, you need to be more alert!”
“Think carefully. With this dagger, we too can live happily! No one will bother you!”
There was no need to know that it was an S-class object belonging to the highest tier of weaponry.
“I will destroy everything. I will punish the people who bullied my family! No, I will destroy Igor!”
“Are you really crazy?”
Mother was angry, but Verdi was already possessed by the magical power of <Slaughter>.
“Carl, can you do it? Will you protect me until the end? My family in this hellish place… … .”
A man’s voice was heard from outside the door.
“no. That’s it.”
The door, apparently locked, opened very naturally, and a man in a robe entered.
“Who, who are you?”
Even though I was relieved that it was not a military uniform, my heart thumped at the calm appearance even after seeing the two corpses.
‘Dead. That’s a fatal wound that can’t be regenerated.’
Concluding that it was certain, Sirone took off her robe and walked towards Verdi.
“I’m here to get a dagger. won’t you hand it over to me? It’s not something you should have.”
Verdi’s eyes went wild.
“Who is your brother who wants this? I don’t think you’re from here, but get out of here before I report it!”
With the exception of the port city of Dormica, no strangers were allowed to enter North Eymond.
“Two people have already died. Better hand it over to me before the number of deaths increases.”
“He deserved to die! They are my mother… … and me… … !”
Tears welled up in Verdi’s eyes.
“Never give up! Without this, you will have to live in hell again! No, I won’t!”
“The name of that dagger is <Defense>.”
Just knowing his name made me feel deprived.
“It’s hard to explain to you, but it’s like magic. Twist causality to cause murder. It is a vicious weapon that has killed countless people since a very long time ago.”
“It’s nasty… … .”
“There is a world of difference between just wanting to kill and really killing. However, there is no difference in <Slaughter>.”
Verdi hurriedly hid the dagger.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s nasty. This knife saved her mother’s life. She didn’t protect our family from anyone!”
Sirone nodded.
“I know you did your best. Because <Defense> must be really earnest to activate. You wanted to protect your family, right?”
“Huh. uhhhhhhh.”
Verdi sobbed.
“I really had no intention of killing him. i really… … I just want to protect her mother… … .”
“okay. But <Slayer> is not as nice as you. So let’s stop here. If this happens again, then it will be you, not Carl.”
Sirone stroked Verdi.
“You cannot protect your family with anger. If you depend on this heinous thing, you lose something really important.”
Verdi burst into tears with a terrified face.
“Aww! mom! Mama!”
“… … .”
Raising the child’s wrist, Sirone grabbed the blade of the dagger and carefully retrieved the <Defense>.

[755] The Doctrine of Evil (2)
* * *
The temple was heading for the worst.
Even after Gustav Havitz, 17, declared war on the world and left the venue, the representatives of each country remained silent.
‘Really a war?’
The reason why the heart beats even though they are at the peak of power is because the opponent is the worst tyrant in human history.
President Vasari of the Republic of Korea, the host country of the temple, opened his mouth with a pale face.
“Should I believe this? So, at this moment, the fact that World War broke out.”
If Havitz sent troops, the first target would be the Republic of Korea, which was closest to Gustaf.
“It is impossible to analyze Harvitz’s thoughts. But if he is true to his desires, it is probably true.”
Even though he was a representative of the same temple, Uorin’s words were special, and President Vasari’s face turned into tears.
“Why? Isn’t it an unwinnable war? The temple will also be damaged, but Gustaf will perish.”
King Kasartak of the Kingdom of Paras said.
“The Gustav Empire’s win rate, calculated at home, was under 10% under the premise of giving up Valkyrie. If it’s simply a madman, even if it means starting a war, just step on it.”
“I’m not crazy.”
Everyone in the temple turned to Uorin.
“Of course, the odds of Gustav winning the war are extremely slim. But under certain circumstances, it is more than 90 percent.”
Jin Kang, the emperor of the Jincheon Empire, asked.
“What is it?”
“Probability of the world going to be a mess.”
The pupils of the representatives from each country shook.
“Havitz thinks it’s not just war. If the Gustav Empire raises its military and spreads to the continent, east, and south, it becomes difficult to protect the psychic realm. In the end, the demons will break through the barricade and come out into the world… … .”
From then on, it’s chaos.
“You are driving it into an unpredictable situation.”
Uorin nodded.
“Havitz moves by instinct, but the Gustav 4th skill is already drawing a picture in your head. It’s worth doing in a situation where the probability becomes meaningless. Also, in such circumstances, Havitz’s abnormal thinking will be a powerful weapon.”
If war is about consuming everything available, Gustav’s strategy to use the underworld was excellent.
‘Havitz, 17 years old. he’s a scary guy It’s more disturbing in that it’s not something I thought about and judged. He’s just feeling it.’
If you truly believe in it, in the end, the world will have no choice but to revolve around you.
“Is this the end of the human story?”
The first class dragon, Blitz, stood up.
“If you’ve heard this far as a member of the temple, the formality must have been met. From now on, I will deliver the agenda of our Balaur.”
It was quite an arrogant tone, but the reason no one was offended was that Blitz deserved it.
‘The 12 apostles who keep time. Among them, the thunder pterosaur is said to be the strongest in terms of combat power.’
It was the first time he had attended the temple as a representative of the Balaur, so the representatives also pricked their ears.
“As of today, the Balaur will leave the temple.”
“… … .”
Like Gustav, anyone can resign if they pay the price, but silence leaked from the venue.
“May I ask why?”
It was not yet time to inform humans.
“The reason the Balaur joined the Crusade was to protect time from Ankera’s Reset. And now Ra’s will has been passed on to Nane, and now it has reached the point of closing time. For us, it is the gong that must be prevented before evil.”
As the direction of Ae and Gong was newly created, the world could no longer be defined by the dichotomy of good and evil.
‘It turns out like this after all.’
Nane, who says that we must leave for the place where the truth is, and Shirone, who say that only the place where we put our hearts is real.
‘This is just the beginning. In the future, countless people will define themselves anew by the compass of the law.’
There will be countries that follow the Gustav Empire, and even the Holy War countries are no exception.
Enox, the representative of the fairies, asked.
“Withdrawal from the temple? So what do we do?”
“Why are you asking me that? You are the representative of the fairies. If you want to stick to humans, do so.”
It was said to be on its own, but it could not hide the nuance that it was not pleasant to be involved in human affairs.
“Hmm.”
While the representatives of the Seven Stars watched with hard faces, only Uorin was convinced.
‘The temple will remain.’
The fairies of heaven and the fairies of the human world are divided into fairies and elves.
Elves are as strong in spirit as fairies, and above all, they have bodies that are close to humans.
‘The level of magic is incomparable to that of humans.’
It is presumably a union between a celestial nymph and a Norse, which meant that a terrible experiment had taken place in the distant past.
“I will stay in the temple. If there is a war, many lives will die, so of course the fairies should help.”
Uorin was terrified.
‘What kind of race could lay down its life for a race weaker than itself?’
If this was also a line, it was too ‘artificial’ line.
“Representative of fairies, your choice seems to warm the hearts of everyone here.”
Enox flushed and stuck out his tongue.
“Hehe, praised. Do not worry. Because fairies have helped humans since ancient times. It’s different from the noble dragons.”
“joy.”
Turning coldly, Blitz changed his body and flew up into the sky before he even left the door.
After breaking through the wall of the ceiling and disappearing, large chunks of stone fell to the spot where the round table had been.
“… … It is the worst crusade.”
* * *
Sirone put the dagger into her bosom.
‘This can’t be reconstructed.’
The reason material can theoretically make anything is because it creates matter.
However, because the significance of <Slaughter> lies not in the material but in the spirit contained in it, it was impossible to imitate.
‘I just make a dagger of the same shape.’
For example, it was the same principle that even if Sirone combined organic matter to create a human body, he could not put life into it.
When Verdi calmed down, her mother stood up.
“I need to clean the house.”
Seeing a dead body was terrifying for her, but it could have killed her entire family.
“I’m going to suck the mop. From blood… … .”
“It’s no use, Mom.”
Verdi shook his head.
“Everyone will find out anyway. Because the house to collect money is set aside. If you don’t run away now, you will be arrested.”
You won’t believe it if you explain <Slaughter>.
That is why what was more feared than the death penalty was the persistent torture aimed at finding out the truth.
“No need to worry.”
Sirone approached Verdi and her mother.
“I don’t have <Defense>, but I will protect you. So let’s find a way together. What would you like me to do?”
Verdi showed an expression of hope for a moment, but soon despair filled his eyes.
“Don’t lie. Why does a strong person like my brother help us? Mom and I are useless anyway.”
He knew at least that the reason he came here was <law killing> and not himself.
“I know you will leave eventually. I don’t have time, I think I’ve done enough for this, and it’s annoying… … .”
A child raised in a harsh environment seemed to know more than an adult in a peaceful world.
“I am not leaving.”
Sirone stroked Verdi with a pitiful expression.
“I will never leave until the means that threaten you and your family are completely gone. I’ll promise.”
If philanthropy meant not being able to kill someone to save someone, Sirone had to deal with the work here.
“really… … Will you protect me?”
The fate of protecting everyone is painful, but I was happy that I didn’t have to leave her right now.
“of course. never bother you are the most valuable person in the world I will do my best to protect you.”
Verdi and her mother burst into tears in front of words and emotions they had never heard in their entire lives.
“thank you. thank you.”
Since there was no time, Sirone regained her composure and looked back at her mother.
“Is this all family? Maybe the vice-gun… … .”
“no. My husband is currently working hard. I work for about a month at a military facility and come back.”
A shadow fell over the mother’s face.
“No matter how much I ask them what they are doing, they don’t say anything. If you find out, the whole family will be massacred. however… … .”
“however?”
“I don’t think it’s normal. When I get home, I don’t eat for three days and just sleep… … I talk strangely in my sleep. I think I’m having a nightmare.”
“What are you talking about?”
I hesitated as if it was embarrassing to say, but my mother finally confessed it.
“I’m not going to give birth to a monster child.”
“Excuse me, but my husband… … .”
“Yes, of course I am a man. He is Verdi’s biological father. But it’s strange that he has such a dream. He asked in the morning and he threw things and got angry. He’s not the type to be angry with his family.”
I had some guesses, but it wasn’t something I would bring up in front of Verdi and her mother.
“great. Let’s go find the consort for now.”
Leaving the bodies of the soldiers unattended, Sirone took Verdi and her mother outside.
Even if he wore a hood, he would quickly become suspicious, so he climbed a mountain and took a long detour to enter a military facility.
‘It’s really strict.’
While sealing the altar, Sirone experienced several countries, but this was the first time that the discipline was this strict.
“Is it really okay if I follow you?”
Verdi and her mother, sitting close behind Sirone, were so tense that it was difficult to breathe.
“Because I don’t know your husband’s face. If you see a face you know, even if it’s not her husband, tell me.”
After passing about 7 buildings while avoiding the iron-clad boundaries, Verdi’s mother pointed to the front.
“Hey, it’s Mr. Albas.”
A man whose eyes were dead enough to be considered a corpse was dragging a cart full of rotten food.
“I am my husband’s friend. God, how can a person do that… … .”
The Alba she remembers was a huge one that weighed over 100 kilograms just a month ago.
“Can you call me?”
Desperate to find her husband, Verdi’s mother plucked up the courage and stepped out of the shadows.
“Mr. Albas. Mr. Albas.”
Albas, who hadn’t even turned his head, suddenly came to his senses and looked back with a shocked expression.
“Mardel? how are you here… … .”
Putting down the handle of the cart, he quickly ran to her left and right and grabbed her by the shoulder.
“it’s crazy? Where do you come from here? Go home quickly!”
“What about your husband? Haven’t you seen my husband?”
Albas finally found Verdi crying and a stranger holding her hand.
“I’ll be thrilled. Are you here to save me?”
“that’s right. This one will protect us. Mr. Albas will also leave.”
Albas lowered his head sullenly.
“Give up. I don’t know what kind of person this brother is, but Baseto can’t go back anymore. Just raise Verdi well. Please tell my family the same.”
“You can’t come back! I hope my husband… … !”
Sirone stopped talking.
“What are you doing here?”
Perhaps, in order to survive here, he would have lived by blocking the thought.
Albas, who was choosing the words to answer, finally realized what he was doing and his face turned pale.
“I don’t know. I don’t know either.”
Albas covered his face and sobbed.
“Here… … The devil lives there.”

[756] The Doctrine of Evil (3)
* * *
“Go in quickly! I want to die!”
At the heart of North Eymond’s 48th Military Facility, a group of soldiers were threatening workers with knives drawn.
“Well, I went in yesterday! Please look!”
“If you draw from the lottery, that’s it! Are you saying you’re going to disobey the Republic’s mission now!”
It was only after the knife entered his throat that the man lowered his head in resignation and grabbed the sack.
If you resist, you will die now, but if you go inside that warehouse, there is still a chance to live.
If 10 people go in, 8 people will come back alive, so it must be a fairly high probability.
However, the problem was that the end of the remaining two did not simply end in death.
“next. Who is the one who voted for the X?”
“That’s me.”
Verdi’s father, Baseto, approached, showing an X on a stick.
“Go in.”
He already knew that resisting would be futile, so he too dragged the remaining sacks towards the warehouse.
“Uh, hey, Bassetto. who will do it first huh? I’m First? Or are you first?”
A colleague who was terrified alone in the same situation was annoyed, but this too was now in a state of victory.
“Do whatever you like.”
The man who rolled his eyes said with a servile smile.
“Well, then you are first. Understand?”
Eight out of 10 survive, but 30 of the 39 who have died so far were first in line.
“… … I will.”
From the moment I opened the warehouse door, an irresistible, impulsive smell stung my nose.
It was a disgusting smell that would be better than sticking your nose into a corpse.
“Krrrr.”
Inside the iron bars installed in the warehouse, silhouettes of monsters larger than humans passed by.
Although they have different shapes, personalities, and habits, the soldiers only called them ‘Garasu’.
‘Let’s stay calm. Just leave the sack and come out.’
When I opened the iron cage door and entered, the monsters turned their heads at the same time and slowly backed away.
“Kreuk. Kreuk. Kreuk.”
Hearing a groaning noise, Bassetto dragged the sack without even breathing.
‘Let’s not provoke it. You can’t make a sound.’
Pulling up a bag with such force that his arm fell off was the only skill he learned here.
“Kiiiii.”
The moment something as sharp as a fingernail pricked his side, Bassetto was forced to incontinence.
‘damn! Is it me?’
It was not yet time to give up.
“… … .”
His extremely sensitive senses sensed Garas’ retreat without even turning his head.
‘Damn you kids! Are you making fun of me?’
The reason why the Karas don’t break through the bars is because the 48th Military Facility provides them with the best materials.
‘Do you feel like an emperor?’
Igor was prepared to pay any price to satisfy the sexual desire of Garas, who was 100,000 times more powerful than a human.
‘To make the strongest army.’
I don’t know if I can really control the glass, but just making a compromise to enter the cage was an achievement.
‘I’m going back to my family.’
The guys in the warehouse were full-bodied, and didn’t even pay attention unless they were particularly interested.
‘done!’
There were also those who put down the sack, but were caught by Garas in a hurry.
‘slowly. Slower.’
After repeating the words “if you want to die, you live” dozens of times, and finally got out of the cage, the Garas sent congratulations.
“Kuh! Kut! Kut!”
Everything was happy at the thought of just living, and on the contrary, the next man became contemplative.
“Congratulations, congratulations. That’s amazing.”
No answer came back.
“That, yes. You can do it. please Please take mine instead… … .”
As Baseto’s eyes tightened and he glared at him as if to kill him, the man dropped his head helplessly.
“but… … No one wants to die.”
Bassetto weakened for a moment, but soon regained his composure and clung to the wall of the warehouse.
Squeaky, unluckily, the lock that had been fine until now opened with a sound, and from then on, the man’s reason was paralyzed.
“ha. ha.”
Bassetto frowned at the sound of heavy breathing, but couldn’t bring himself to speak.
‘calm down. If you do as usual, nothing will happen.’
“Huh.”
At the sound of sobbing, Garas, who was in the corner, showed interest and stuck out his tongue.
The wet thing wrapped around his neck and squeezed it tightly, and the man’s hand relaxed.
“Help me.”
Baseto’s eyes widened.
‘You fool! Just stay here! Don’t say anything!’
“Please save me. Please. You came in yesterday too. I can’t die like this… … Aaaaaa!”
His tongue quickly grabbed the man, and Bassetto kicked off the ground and ran to the exit.
“Sal, save me! Aaaaaa!”
Without even looking that way, Bassetto pounded on the warehouse door.
“open it! Hurry up and open the door, you bastards!”
The blinding window opened, and a cold gaze quickly scanned the inside of the warehouse.
“Open it! You did your job right!”
“The iron window is open. close it.”
“Sir… … !”
Swearing came out spontaneously, but the anger immediately cooled in front of the desire for survival.
Pushing the door with both hands, he rushed to the barricade, and the man who was crushed by the giant glass reached out his hand.
“please! me some… … Aaaaaa!”
Bassetto, who even confirmed that the man’s eyes were curling up, closed the bars and lowered the lock.
“Kiyaaaa!”
I was dizzy when the excited Garas pushed through the black shadow.
I didn’t know how I backed away, and I got stuck on the wall of the warehouse, and things like snakes were wriggling out of the curved bars.
“Big!”
Gritting my teeth and running to the side, the warehouse door opened and my vision was filled with light.
is the light of life
“Aaaaaaa!”
Just in case the door was closed, I kicked off the ground with all my might and rolled on the ground.
‘Please, please someone save me! Honey, Verdi!’
Bassetto covered his ears and sobbed at the terrible screams of his colleague in the warehouse.
“Uhhh! Whoa!”
Another victim came out.
* * *
Major Jaycee, who had escaped from the 48th Military Facility, arrived deep in the Galchan Mountains surrounding Pacia, the capital of North Eymond.
‘Aren’t you here yet? It’s five minutes before the appointment time.’
Although he is acting as an officer in North Eymond, he was actually a spy who infiltrated South Eymond six years ago.
‘I endured only for today.’
It was a mission that would have been impossible if it were not for an unofficial 3rd class wizard specializing in espionage warfare.
“Jacey!”
Three soldiers emerged from the bushes.
The captain was Jacey’s husband.
“Why are you so late?”
“Sorry. It took longer than expected to cross the border. I’m glad you came over safely.”
After a short kiss, Jacey searched for her arms and said.
“I do not have time. Two days ago, the North succeeded in controlling Garras for the first time. If we don’t take action soon… … .”
“Dirty things! Did you really succeed?”
“Fortunately, I’m not at the level of taming higher creatures yet. But the fact that it was successful is what matters.”
As time goes by, technology is bound to evolve.
“Deliver this document to the royal castle. That’s all the information I’ve gathered about Garas. I’ll go over in three days.”
If she left the army now, there would be a nationwide emergency and there was a high possibility that her husband would be arrested.
“Your place is the torture chamber.”
Jacey’s eyes fluttered in shock as North Eymond’s men walked through the brush.
“how… … .”
I thought it was thoroughly hidden.
“Has the world changed? You should know that there are eyes even where you don’t know.”
behind the world.
‘No, it’s impossible. The inhabitants of the other side of the world would never compromise with humans, right?’
“Don’t even think about being taken lightly. I’m in a pretty bad mood right now.”
As the gendarmerie commander pulled out his sword and approached, Jacey cast invisibility magic and shouted.
“Disperse! Get out!”
As she disappeared and fired an electric bolt from an unexpected place, the military police threw themselves at her.
‘Are you saying it’s not trash?’
Invisibility was the highest level of lightning magic, especially illusion magic.
“… … Things are getting interesting.”
As the spies fled, the military police chief gave the order.
“Call the beast king.”
A signal flare was fired, and 3 minutes later, 20 soldiers dragged 2-meter-high dogs.
Krrrrrrrr!
A dog with ironclad hair all over its body, a dog with hundreds of holes in its body, a dog with deadly poison flowing from its teeth… … .
The monsters created using glass were moving in perfect order according to the hand signal.
Garas – Heterogeneous Dog.
‘It’s definitely a great achievement.’
It is the dog’s genes that North Eymond biologists have used to control Garras.
It was still in its infancy, but if it was possible to train it, sooner or later the empire would be equipped with a force that was not frightening.
“Are you really obeying? If we only trust the dog and let go of the enemy, our necks will not be safe either.”
The captain of the Suwangdae said confidently.
“Do not worry. It is a dog of the Republic that faithfully accomplishes dangerous tasks.”
“How is the performance?”
“It’s so great I can’t even put it into words. You better take a look. Just give me instructions.”
The military police captain looked back at the forest with furious eyes.
“Find all the garbage in the south and take it.”
20 minutes after that.
From the middle of the Galchan Mountains, desperate screams were heard.
“No eh eh!”
Lee Hyeong-dok’s sense of smell quickly found the spies, and Jaycee’s husband was decapitated with the military police chief’s sword.
“You bad guys! kill! Kill me too!”
Jacey, who was hit by a heterogeneous dog that relaxes the large muscles, missed the point of suicide.
“Unpleasant. To be called a bad guy by a thief trying to steal information from another country.”
“shut up! There are human rights even in war! Do you know what you guys are doing?”
“Of course you know. You are at war.”
The military police chief stepped on Jacey’s face.
“Keugh!”
I didn’t like the way her expression ferociously raised her eyes even when her cheeks were pressed down.
“You know enough about how the Republic interrogates criminals, right? It’s good to tell how far you’ve been involved.”
“Kill.”
Without this level of resolution, they would not have been able to infiltrate the enemy country and survive for six years.
“You’re kicking human rights with your own feet.”
When the military police chief turned his head, a black-haired, black-haired dog approached him, salivating.
“I’m going to go through hell for the next 10 minutes. We’ll talk again after that. The only time to stop is now.”
“… … kill it.”
A researcher at Suwang University opened the file folder.
“Experimental Data 38-7. Experimental Sample Bestark Jacey. 36 years old. Start recording.”
“Aaaaaaa!”
Just as Jace closed his eyes and screamed, the military police captain, feeling the presence of people, quickly turned around.
The identity of the person he did not realize until he got close to him, even using the sensory schema… … .
“… … What are you?”
It was a young girl wearing a wide-brimmed cone hat and holding a broom in one hand.
“Human, human.”
Only then did the military police officers realize the voice of an adult woman breaking the harmony and back down.
‘Did I have a dream?’
As if the scene up until now had been an illusion, the child’s figure had disappeared and a bewitching face struck her gaze.
“Why do you kill and kill and there is no end?”
Ivory Tower Odaeseong.
Human Security Enforcement Director Mirac Minerva.

[757] The Doctrine of Evil (4)
“What is that woman?”
When the gendarmerie moved to surround her, the gendarmerie commander held up his hand to stop her.
“stop.”
It was a strange feeling.
And having a strange feeling meant that the military police captain had a much higher level of sense than other military police.
‘What the hell is this?’
I felt like throwing up, and once I realized that, my head was unbearably dizzy.
“What are you doing! ask quickly! Hiss! Hiss!”
Hearing the tumultuous sound of the Suwangdae, he slowly turned his head with a firm expression.
It was a shocking sight.
“Hey, why is this guy like this?”
Heterogeneous breed dogs that have undergone improvement after improvement using Karas are braver than wild beasts and are designed to absolutely obey the owner’s words.
“in action! I mean move!”
But even when I hit him on the butt with a whip with a leather belt attached to it, he just looked into the distance.
As if he desperately denied the woman in front of him.
‘I’m afraid.’
The disgusting energy the military police commander felt, something unknown was spreading from her body.
“Dogs are better than people.”
As Minerva approached, the heteromorphic dogs quietly scattered to the corners of the forest as if something had happened.
Their movements, which they couldn’t even express in extreme fear, resembled the psychology of the people who feed the warehouses of Garas.
“Wow!”
As Minerva passed by, the military police chief could not stand it and poured out gastric juices.
“What, Captain?”
The members looked puzzled, but the military police chief was not at all envious of those who did not feel fear.
‘I lived because I vomited.’
In another three minutes or so, the subordinates would die instantly, without even knowing why, from being crushed by the woman’s energy.
“Come here, cute puppies.”
If caught, die.
Realizing this by instinct, the heterogeneous breed dogs sniffed the flowers inappropriately and acted different.
A heterogeneous breed of dog that spews out powerful venom sneaked away and was eventually caught by her hand.
Unable to even think of running away with its two powerful legs, it accepted the hand, and the wide dog legs bent all the way to the floor.
‘It’s a death god.’
How many lives do you have to kill to get that kind of energy?
Beautiful appearance, witch’s outfit.
‘Mirac Minerva.’
The military police commander realized that it was wrong to live with ARMY.
“oh.”
Heterogeneous dogs trembled with their hind legs fully laid down, and soon hot urine leaked out onto the floor.
“Are you scared? I?”
Whoa, whoa… … !
Water leaked out of the eyes, nose, and mouth of the 20-year-old dog, and the military policemen rolled over their eyes one by one and collapsed.
“Okay, let’s see.”
Minerva walked towards her hips and bent down to look down at the dripping urine.
“It’s a male.”
Yep! Break it up!
The breed dog Lee Hyung-dok let out a final scream.
“die.”
As if a switch had been pressed, the dog’s eyes immediately flipped over and fell to its side.
“Three, my God… … .”
Leaning against the tree trunk, Jace looked in disbelief at the dying lives everywhere.
The members of the Suwang Corps and the military police who collapsed vomiting blood, and finally, the dogs of the Heterogeneous Dogs died in a fight.
“Even if it’s an ivory tower… … .”
The only surviving gendarmerie captain gasped and glared at Minerva.
“I can’t stop it now. Under the grace of President Igor, the Republic of North Eymond will rule the world.”
“okay.”
Minerva snapped a finger and the life of the military police officer escaped from his body.
“Go to the other world and do a lot, world domination.”
Jacey, who was the only one left with his life, asked, breathing heavily.
“you… … Are you an ivory tower resident?”
Minerva took a smoking pipe from the barrel of her broomstick, put it in her mouth, and lit it.
‘Are you ignoring me?’
Jace opened his mouth again.
“Then we must hit North Eymond quickly! Otherwise, the Garas will invade the world.”
Minerva exhaled smoke with a dejected expression.
“know.”
Then, he slowly approached Jacey, brought her to eye level, and raised her cheek at once.
Jace, who turned his head with a slap, put on an absurd expression for a moment, then immediately fired at him.
“Why are you hitting me! The one who can’t even move!”
Minerva hated humans.
If it’s a human being who thinks, “If I say this way, he will move that way.” … .
It’s disgusting enough to give you goosebumps.
‘I’d rather roll around with a dog.’
Still, Minerva doesn’t show it.
“sorry. I was wondering if this would solve it.”
Jacey bit her teeth with a look of resentment, but she had no intention of fighting the witch who had subdued the dog with only her energy.
“I know you. Archwitch, Mirach Minerva.”
Most of the five great stars of the Ivory Tower are shrouded in mystery, but Minerva was the most spectacular debut in the history of the Ivory Tower.
“What are you going to do next? Are you going to tell Igor to stop the experiment? or not… … .”
“I will take care of it.”
To be honest, nothing has been decided yet, but once I get to the capital and meet the president, everything will be settled.
“Please take me too.”
Minerva’s eyes were cold.
“… … Why?”
“Because I know something you don’t know yet. If you go to the capital like this, you will probably be in trouble.”
“Knock-knock!”
The witch’s laughter spread through the forest.
“Hey, little girl. Oh sorry. you are younger than me Of course, at face value, I am much younger.”
“… … .”
“Anyway, if you knew what kind of life Archwitch Minerva lived, you wouldn’t dare say the word “failure.”
I felt the aura of death.
“Even if you can’t move your limbs, you know you can do everything as long as your snout is alive. that’s you guys Terrify me any more and you will follow them.”
“porridge… … .”
A voice drowned in crying broke out.
“I want to kill you! The motherF*cking northerners who killed my husband! I want to kill every single one of them!”
Jace ej*culated with a contorted face.
“Please take me! There is nothing left! If I can kill even one more person, even my soul… … !”
anger.
It was the purest emotional state of human beings, the only one Minerva was not averse to.
“… … Tell me what you know.”
Jace suddenly came to his senses.
“The military police chief said that there are eyes even where you can’t see. North Korea is using the other side of the world. Otherwise, there is no way my identity will be exposed.”
“It could be because you can’t handle your work.”
“What are you looking at me for? A person who has mastered all the magic of espionage!”
No matter how much she screamed, not even a tooth could go in against Minerva.
“Ha, okay. So, there is a possibility that Igor may have colluded with the demons.”
It wasn’t to the point of failure, but it was the awkward part.
“I’ll take you.”
Minerva inhaled deeply, gathering the smoke between her lips and whispering quietly.
“Open your mouth.”
As if possessed, Jacey opened her lips and Minerva leaned over and kissed her.
‘ah… … .’
The smell of smoke passing through her lungs was like burning grass, and Jacey fell into an ecstasy she had never experienced before.
Detoxification Magic – Witch’s Breath.
I lost consciousness for a moment, but it was only a moment.
“it’s okay. You should be able to move now.”
I felt the nerves from my toes, and my muscles tightened as if it had happened at some point.
Jace, who awkwardly stood up from his seat, had nothing to say.
“I-over there… … .”
Lip contact is not a problem.
I couldn’t bear to lift my face at the fact that I felt the utmost bliss through her body.
“Don’t lie with a witch.”
The number of people who ended their lives because of the sweetness given by the witch was numerous, even in the case of Minerva.
“… … They hate humans.”
Leaving Jacey nodding blankly behind, Minerva concentrated her magic on her broomstick.
The shabby wooden material popped open and turned into a two-meter staff with a propulsion engine on the back.
Z, the best projectile of mankind, created by Taeseong’s intellect in return for giving up <Slaughter>.
Since it was officially registered in the Ivory Tower, it was a means of transportation that had to be correct.
“get on. Stop at a military facility and then enter the capital.”
Minerva sat lightly on the jet floating at a height of 1 meter with her thighs resting on it.
“Ah yes.”
It was introduced in the history books as the fastest thing in the world, so Jacey gulped and took a back seat.
“Hey, do I have to press? If you fall… … .”
“I do not need.”
The jet glowed purple for a moment, and as if trapped in a soft mould, the body was fixed without any effort.
“Goes.”
At the same time as Minerva’s horse fell, a great spark spewed from the jet’s propulsion engine.
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
Jacey screamed at the sight of the sky speeding up despite barely feeling any inertia.
‘too fast!’
As the jet, which circled the sky once, accelerated in earnest, a sonic explosion exploded in just four seconds.
It was Mach speed.
* * *
Verdi’s mother, who found Baseto with a bewildered face, covered her mouth with tears.
“honey… … .”
What the hell happened to a person to that point?
“Bad children… … .”
Bassetto looked shocked and stunned, and his eyes were swollen from how much he cried.
“I need to bring my husband. I will die there.”
The moment Verdi’s mother, who had lost her temper, stepped forward, Sirone said in a cold voice.
“Don’t move.”
Verdi’s mother flinched and stopped.
“It looks like everything is still safe, so let’s be patient and watch. If you create a disturbance here, the number of victims increases.”
It is the spirit of fraternity that one cannot kill another person to save Baseto.
‘It’s really strange.’
However, the biggest reason for Sirone still not taking action was something else.
‘There are too many demons.’
In the other side world seen through Bakji’s senses, demons were patrolling in pairs.
‘But this place is outside the psychic realm?’
The underside world shares space coordinates with reality, but since the altar was opened, I tend to keep as far away as possible.
Thinking that she couldn’t take everyone with her, Sirone turned to Albas and said.
“Please protect Verdi and Mom. I will follow them and bring Mr. Baseto back.”
“But how are you going? From now on, there is nowhere to hide. This is a supply route for storing large-scale logistics.”
There was an endless expanse of open space for ten wagons to pass side by side.
“In terms of space, yes.”
Albas tilted his head, but he wouldn’t understand even if I explained it anyway.
‘Choeni Bardo.’
When Pakji and Sipok were combined, the reality and the world behind them overlapped, and Sirone’s appearance disappeared.
“Unbelievable… … .”
Albas looked around.
“Where have you been?”
Of course, Sirone was still by their side, and after checking the location of the demons, she stroked Verdi’s head.
“Hang in there. I will definitely rescue her father.”
Verdi suddenly thought of an answer.
“Where are you going?”
Why is my heart suddenly beating fast?
“Of course I went to rescue my dad.”

[758] The Doctrine of Evil (5)
* * *
The world behind Sirone’s eyes seemed to be filled with things that humans hate.
After passing through the fields of villi along the intestines, a grotesque stone statue that usually appears in religious paintings came out.
‘This is unexpected… … .’
It was good to follow Baseto through the other world, but at some point, the scenery of reality was not visible.
‘Mr. Miro… … .’
Zion’s law to reduce the psychic realm is putting pressure on the whole world.
The thin border that could be torn at any time had turned into an iron barrier.
‘I’ll cheer you on.’
If it was a choice for humanity, it was something she would have to endure, but rather, her level was admirable.
‘Following is no longer possible.’
Missing Baseto, Sirone intended to find an exit as soon as possible and return to the real world.
‘weird. It’s really strange.’
The number of demons that Sirone figured out on the way to this place was well over a thousand.
‘I can’t escape from here anyway. Most troops should be deployed within the psychic realm… … .’
It was a strange thing because fierce wars were going on in the vicinity of the psychic realm regardless of which country.
‘The psychic realm is the forefront of demons and humans. It’s impossible unless one of them gives up… … .’
Maybe it was both.
r r r r r.
The sound of water running through the intestines was heard, and the outer wall where Sirone was located was violently shaken.
“this… … !”
The wind blew first, followed by the rotten smell.
Whew!
With a disgusting sound, the turbid filth poured in like a flood, and Sirone hurriedly flew into the sky.
“Keugh!”
“help me! help me!”
Skeletons drifting along the torrent of filth raised their bony arms at the sight of Sirone.
philanthropy.
“Take my hand!”
The moment they held hands, their shoulders were severed, and the arms that fell off the torso quickly turned to black ash.
‘Purification of the soul.’
After sealing several altars, I realized that it was a waste of time, but I couldn’t help but hold out my hand.
‘But this is the first time it’s been this severe… … .’
The spirit of the real world permeates the underworld and is recycled as an energy source for demons.
‘The sexual play of the witches’ meeting, the assembly of the devil’s followers.’
The collective consciousness born in such a place is powerful and stimulating enough to paralyze the brain.
However, sometimes the consciousness of an individual becomes powerful enough to match that.
It was death.
‘They are already dead.’
There are not many people who can overcome the fear of death except religious people who are sure of God’s salvation and seekers who realize the futility of life.
The moment the powerful fear explodes, the consciousness is sucked into the other world and falls to hell.
‘I’m sorry.’
When I think of their fate of falling into a place called the ‘Fire Plate’ and melting in hellfire, Nane comes to mind.
‘You might be right.’
Shirone, who prevented her tears from burning, hurriedly came to her senses and shook her head.
‘I can’t collapse.’
The realm of Yahweh loves everything that exists, but the inhabitants of the other world were insubstantial.
‘It’s just a hell we made.’
The true salvation was not to close the world, but to liberate all mankind through the practice of love.
After the purification of the soul, which was more terrible than in other places, Sirone came down to the ground again.
The face of the woman hanging from the grotesque stone statue changed before she knew it and was laughing with her mouth wide open.
“… … .”
The remnants of his soul were stuffed in his mouth.
Suddenly, the woman’s eyes turned to Sirone, and she began to laugh as she chewed on the leftovers.
“Kyahahahaha! hahahahaha… … !”
bang!
The face of the stone statue hit by the photon cannon fell off and rolled on the floor.
“Haaaaa… … .”
Who are you fighting for?
Sometimes, in fact, often, I couldn’t control my anger when I saw the world that humans had committed without responsibility.
“How dare you destroy the stone statue of purification!”
The vicious demons who heard the sound came and filled the inside of the rotten intestines.
“Answer me.”
the human heart
“How can you guys realize love?”
In the history of hell, there were no seekers who came to ask this question, so the demons also chose the answer.
“There is only one way.”
A demon with horns like a cow came forward and opened its arms wide.
“Submit to me and worship me. Then I will love you.”
Because only me is important.
“Puhahaha! Good answer! answer! You who seek the Tao! Why worry about something so easy?”
All the demons spread their arms.
“Worship me!”
Sirone closed her eyes tightly, and when her eyelids, heavy as the world, opened again.
“Kill! The flesh of the investigators tastes amazing!”
Yahweh’s light raged.
“Ha ha ha! Will the drug rise and die? You are stupid to expect kindness from humans! Your light is strong, it burns us… … .”
Despite the mixed voices of the demons in the middle of hell, Sirone did not stop shining.
“I am not afraid at all! So don’t give in! Until the moment of complete extinction, we will fight!”
The only way to seal the altar was to burn all the demons in the area with the light of Yahweh.
“How miserable! Foolish and foolish… … !”
Yahweh.
In the place where the screaming sound disappeared, a world of nothingness as wide as the brilliance of Yahweh was open.
“radish.”
It was neither dark nor transparent.
Just ‘nothing’ that humans couldn’t think of was so strange that there weren’t many people except Sirone who could stand it.
Because I couldn’t stand that futility.
“Let there be light.”
Sirone got into the habit of filling the place where the altar was sealed with something with material.
‘Although my skills are still lacking.’
I felt much more comfortable just by embodying the stone statue of the archangel in the mother’s womb in a pure white space.
‘Ikael.’
In Hexa’s memory, the image of her sobbing as she clutched at her chest came to mind.
‘It must have been a miserable sight.’
Why does it feel like every time I recall this memory, the anger in my heart is washed away?
“Lactas Vera Imera (Submit to Fear)!”
Surprised by the familiar voice for a moment, Sirone looked back at the scenery of hell outside the material realm.
“Igor.”
Igor, the Lord of Terror riding on an eyeless black horse, approached with a spear of blue flame hanging down.
“This isn’t your area, is it?”
In terms of coordinates in the real world, it should have been in Radum.
“I have come to retrieve the mark of servitude.”
Igor’s words stopped in front of the pure white borderline filled with the new material.
It didn’t matter, but mentally I would have been terribly reluctant to step out.
“Pass it. I fight for Satan.”
In Sirone’s arms, Igor’s necklace turned into a blue starlight and floated to Igor.
“You found me with this.”
Just before falling into Igor’s grasp, the starlight stopped moving and did not advance.
“… … Are you rejecting it?”
Until now, Sirone was Igor’s master.
“What if I refuse?”
“Satan will destroy me. Even so, a new name of fear will only appear.”
The more often humans feel, the faster they resurrect in the underworld.
“It’s a new name… … .”
North Eymond’s name was also Igor.
“Does this have anything to do with it?”
“Nothing. There are many Igors in the human world. And some Igor use fear as a weapon.”
Igor, the Lord of Terror, was born when that emotion combined with the soul melted in Hellfire.
“He is first, and I am second. Don’t be confused.”
If the emotions were strong enough to become a division commander in hell, it was worth knowing what Igor was like.
“Tell me what is going on where I am.”
Igor shut his mouth.
“It is a condition to cancel the oath of obedience.”
Still wanting to fight for Satan, Igor nodded heavily.
“Igor, that is to say, the person who gave me personality does not currently exist in this world.”
“You mean dead?”
“It was absorbed. Half of the kingdom army you are currently staying in is non-human demons.”
“A demon?”
Changing the form means changing the material as well as the function, so it is not easy for the Demons.
It’s a different story if it’s illusion magic, but there’s no way that Sirone, who has reached the level of Yahweh, won’t notice.
“How could that be… … .”
Sirone suddenly realized.
“Garas?”
“okay. The mixed blood of demons and garras dominates the army. Karasura. It’s a great tribe. After they came over to the kingdom, a tremendous amount of energy entered the underworld. The demons born there are now pushing out the existing corps commander and taking on a new corps commander. Even if it were you, you wouldn’t be able to guarantee a victory.”
Since no opponent had ever been sure of a match, Sirone’s heart only beat a little faster.
“You must know that demons are born from the energy source of the fire. The reason they are different is that they inherit certain characteristics of Satan. Conversely… … .”
“So the aggregate of evil is called Satan.”
Demons call themselves evil, but just believe that evil is the truth, just as humans see good as beautiful.
“How far into North Eymond did you infiltrate?”
“All. The kingdom you are in has already been occupied by demons. This is what the human named Igor decided for himself.”
“self?”
“He really wanted to be a horror. So he gave his body to a being greater than himself. Therefore, those who currently rule the country are actually demons, and they are one of the few who can change into human form.”
“… … Commander of the corps.”
Considering that only the first-class dragons among dragons could change their form, they could feel the power of the corps commander.
“Commander of the 24th Corps of Satan’s 72nd Corps, Maraduk.”
It was Maraduk of ruin.
“We are all part of Satan. In particular, the corps commander inherited the most powerful things of Satan. If you think it is the same as subjugating me, Yahweh will lose its light.”
Igor said to Sirone, who was lost in thought.
“This is all I can say. If you want to know more, you have no choice but to annihilate me.”
“… … I’ll give it back, necklace.”
At last, the blue starlight permeated Igor.
“It doesn’t matter if you destroy me like this.”
“know. but… … .”
Even being able to share something with the demons was so precious to Sirone.
“Because I got help.”
Igor turned the black horse.
“There will be no such thing in the future.”
As Sirone watched as they receded into the scenery of hell, Igor stood tall.
Is it really good?
It was a short time, but it might have permeated Sirone’s shared feelings through Igor’s necklace.
“Not at all.”
Igor seemed to be talking to himself, but… … .
“A demon who repented of his sins.”
It sounded like thunder in Sirone’s ears.
“Geuk, the problem is that there are almost none.”
Igor, who clearly drew the line, disappeared without looking back until the end.
Sirone couldn’t move for a long time.
‘there was.’
Both fists were clenched.
‘I can fight more. I’m not wrong!’
My breath caught in my chest as if it were on fire, and hot tears ran down my cheeks.
‘Never give up. No matter how bad humans are… … .’
It wasn’t necessarily evil.

[759] Possibility (1)
Having infiltrated the 48th Military Facility, Minerva and Jaycee opened the way by mercilessly punishing the garrison.
In the first place, it was Jacey who volunteered to be the guide, but the reason why he didn’t have to was because no one had approached Minerva.
“Save me, save me… … !”
The death energy from Minerva caused the soldiers to fall on the spot and die moaning in pain.
‘The Five Great Castles of the Ivory Tower.’
Jace also lived with pride in his status as an unofficial third-class wizard, but on a completely different level.
‘I haven’t seen magic yet.’
Minerva, who overpowered the army with only her energy, moved to the laboratory in the Central Office.
“wait a minute!”
Jacey exclaimed hastily.
“This is where the original Garas is! The moment it opens, there will be an uproar.”
“Garasu has no prototype. Exactly no one knows the prototype. Because they are the ones who destroy the biological system.”
“That makes it even more dangerous. It is on a different level from heterogeneous breed dogs that have been brought up to the level of a species. I will catch whatever I see and breed them.”
“doesn’t care. open it.”
Jace couldn’t resist her, and eventually unlocked the iron door.
Another iron door appeared, and when it was opened, the prison that contained Garas was visible.
“Kurrrr! Krrrr!”
As Minerva took a step, Garras’ hideous voice resounded from all directions.
‘This is the first time I’ve been so excited.’
As Jacey trembled and followed, Minerva stopped in the center of the warehouse.
“It smelled like a witch. For them, it will be a more powerful aphrodisiac than any aphrodisiac.”
“Shall we open them one by one?”
“no.”
As Minerva’s eyes narrowed and she swung her jet, her body changed into that of a young girl.
“Welcome, sweet children.”
At the same time as the horse fell, dozens of iron doors were ripped open with a bang.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
The blood disappeared from Jace’s face, who had watched the experiment to see what kind of race Garas was.
‘As expected, I overcame it.’
Unlike the dog breed, Garras’s desire transcended even Minerva’s life.
But Minerva was still staring straight ahead with half-closed eyes.
‘Destined to become a witch.’
By the time she realized that she couldn’t escape, her body and mind were already in tatters.
“If this is my fate, I have no choice but to accept it.”
Dozens of Garas attacked her.
“Mr. Minerva!”
Judging that it was already too late, Jacey turned around and tried to run away, but something surprising happened.
“Ah! Aagh!”
However, the shape of the tangled glass bubbled like oil, and the number began to decrease little by little.
“Witch’s Breath.”
Before I knew it, she bit the smoking pipe and came out through the gap of the glass, puffing out smoke.
“How did you do it?”
“I had a lot of fun. between themselves.”
As far as Jacey knows, Garas’ desire to reproduce is the pinnacle of living things, but he never combined with the same species.
“Is the sexual desire 100,000 times that of humans? If that’s the case, it’ll be about 100 million times now. At that point, nothing can be seen.”
“100 million times… … .”
The appearance of them united into one mass was like a lump of black oil, and countless mutants repeated birth and extinction.
Minerva watched indifferently and said.
“Biological systems consist of reproduction and feeding. Garas has the property of maximizing the compatibility of the breeding system and extending it to the entire ecosystem. But what if you combine the same species?”
Jacey turned around and Minerva raised a finger.
“After all, evolution is impossible. After repeating countless mutations among themselves, what they choose is stability. And that means… … .”
“It’s going back to square one.”
Minerva watched without answering, and what finally appeared in front of them was a black sphere about a meter in diameter.
Like a tadpole egg, the sphere trapped in the mucous membrane vibrated and split in the middle, splitting into two.
“Selra… … .”
As the eruption proceeded, the size of the black spheres decreased and the number increased exponentially.
When the number of cells exceeded 40 trillion in cycles, the human form was finally revealed.
“I wanted to meet you once. Argones.”
the father of all life in the universe.
Also, Taeseong, who belongs to the category of mother, called Argones a biological program early on.
When Argones’ mouth opened, the mucus that was blocking his throat cleared and a voice was heard.
“He wanted to meet me.”
There was no pitch in the tone of his voice, as if someone who did not know the language spoke only with sound.
Minerva didn’t care.
“Ankera is gone. It’s impossible without your involvement. What are you up to?”
If it was truly a biological program, it would have been Argones who provided Ankera’s body.
“I don’t embellish anything. Spread the creature far and wide. It fills the space with more objects, even where there is no sun.”
“He is a very conscientious official. Sooner or later, this world may be closed completely.”
“It doesn’t matter, my daughter.”
Minerva’s eyebrows twitched.
“You are the lowest probability and the most important probability among those created because of me. Kill as you wish, breed as you wish. That’s what your odds mean.”
“I wasn’t made for a need like yours.”
“I don’t care what you think. I didn’t make you either. You were just chosen by chance.”
“Bastard.”
Minerva’s eyes lit up with life.
“Do you think that is the reason for my pain?”
“It eliminates mutations.”
Argones’s body became watery like porridge and soaked into the floor.
“It’s dangerous!”
Argones, who had turned into slime, emerged from the walls on all sides and attacked Minerva and Jacey.
“Mukus.”
No one was already in the place where the slime waves were rushing in, and Minerva, who flew into a corner, shot the jet to the ground.
“Breath of Ruin.”
As if time had sped up around Minerva, black smoke rose at a frightening speed.
As Jace, who was standing behind her, sensed the power and cast defense magic, smoke spread forward as if an explosion had occurred.
Kurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
The sound of a building collapsing was heard from a place shrouded in black smoke, and it quickly grew out of control.
‘How far… … .’
When the magic smoke dissipated and the sight finally opened, Jacey shivered.
Mirac Minerva’s magic, which she first confirmed, was at the level of turning all visible scenery to ashes.
‘This isn’t magic. It’s a disaster.’
There was nothing rising above the ground 200 meters ahead of the fan-shaped spread, only black hills of ash piled up.
“Tsk, you’re annoying me.”
Minerva, who had returned to her adult form, turned to Jacey while spinning her jet.
“let’s go. There is still one more thing left to check.”
Without saying a word, she just nodded her head.
‘If this person… … .’
She would be able to get the greatest revenge on the North Eymond Republic for killing her husband.
* * *
“Let go! free me! I want you to send me home!”
Bassetto realized the situation he was in when he saw the only structure in front of him.
shabby cabin.
It was a place called the cabin of eternity by the workers, and once you entered it, you could never come out.
“You did everything you were told to do! why the hell… … Kuck!”
The soldier struck Baseto hard on the back of the head with the hilt of the saber.
“If you want to be black, you will wear it, there are a lot of words. Don’t struggle needlessly, go inside.”
It was a problem even if I did my job too well.
It was a conclusion made by soldiers who grasped Baseto’s ability to judge coolly in a crisis situation.
“You are fixed from today.”
“You children! What have I done wrong!”
There was another blunt impact, and the soldiers grabbed Bassetto by the scruff of the neck and threw him into the cabin.
“I know you are lucky. You can eat a full meal in a private house that other workers can’t even dream of.”
It was said to be begging for food like a dog in a solitary cell with no means of suicide.
‘Damn the kids… … !’
If I was with the workers, I’d rather tie them up and then ask them to strangle me.
“Send me home. to send me home… … .”
Bassetto, who had been squatting in the corner of the cabin and sobbing, felt someone’s presence and raised his head.
“what… … !”
Sirone climbed through the floor of the cabin as if there were stairs in the basement.
“Phew, I finally found it.”
The Law of Zion, which had to cover the entire world, had holes drilled here and there to maximize efficiency.
“Hee! Ears, ghosts!”
Bassetto struggled with his legs, rubbing his back against the wall with nowhere else to back.
After experiencing so many terrible things, it seemed that the grim reaper had finally come to pick them up.
“pee.”
Sirone, who calmed Basseto by placing her hand on her lips, looked at the movement outside and then asked.
“Are you Verdi’s father?”
Bassetto’s eyes, which had been making a frightened expression, suddenly changed and rushed at him.
“How about Verdi? Family, where is my family? Answer me! What the hell did you do to my daughter… … !”
He seemed to think he had taken his family hostage.
“Everyone is fine. I came to hear what Mr. Albas said. Get out of here with me.”
“Al, Albas? Was he alive?”
Bassetto’s eyes were filled with relief.
“I will take you to my family. Hide in a safe place until we finish the job here.”
“You mean to finish? what the hell This is a dictatorship ruled by President Igor.”
The five great castles of the Ivory Tower were transnational.
“I have a way. get out at once If any soldiers come… … .”
Sirone stopped talking and pricked up his ears.
“what?”
An explosion erupted outside the cabin, echoing people’s screams from all directions.
“for a moment… … No, follow me!”
Judging by the size of the explosion, hiding inside a building seemed more dangerous.
As soon as I opened the door and went out, the demons completely engulfed the space and slaughtered the soldiers and workers.
“honey! Verdi!”
As Bassetto stomped his feet, Sirone hugged him and teleported him.
“It’s dangerous!”
Fireball exploded.
Where Sirone turned her head, she saw a woman in Northern Eymond’s military uniform casting magic.
‘Why are they on the same side?’
It was Jaycee, a North Korean spy.
“joy! quite… … !”
Seeing Sirone dodging the fireball, she cast fly magic and attacked.
A spy couldn’t have a sincere ally, and everyone here was her enemy.
‘I’m going to kill them all! Abominable bastards!’
The death of her husband, who was the only family she returned to after six years of penetrating life, devoting her youth.
“You guys feel the same way!”
Carrying Minerva on her back, she cast invisibility magic right in front of Sirone.
If it’s a being that relies on its eyes, it’s safe to say that it’s already dead… … .
‘This way!’
Sirone’s senses were three levels higher than humans’, and the photon cannon accurately captured the target.
‘How can I… … ?’
Jacey was dizzy.
‘Press!’
The moment when the experience of a 3rd-class wizard compresses the air to form a high-strength curtain.
bang!
The impact of the photon cannon hit Jaina in the stomach, vibrating the press harder than rebar.
“Gagging!”
With the magic of invisibility broken, she realized that she didn’t know where the shock wave was pushing her.
‘I’m not just a wizard.’
It was the first shock I ever experienced.

[76] Return of the Archmage (3)
Iron Krung. Iron Krung.
As I was thinking about that, I heard the sound of chains from the prison cell at the end of the hallway. When a man resembling a wolf appeared, Arcane’s eyes lit up with interest.
My thoughts were different from those who jumped out without covering their fronts just because a barbed wire was opened. Besides, I liked that he was handcuffed in addition to the shackles.
“There is still one more left. Did you hide your presence? The schema is quite good.”
The man inspected the faces of the fallen prisoners and let out a dejected laugh.
“Heh heh heh, I’m stumped. do you know where this is? West prison called Inferno. Are you thinking of treason?”
“Treason. It’s fun. Will you join us?”
The man shrugged.
“There’s nothing I can’t do if you let me go.”
“Even if you couldn’t see, your ears would have been open. There is no freedom unless you defeat me.”
“Haa, that’s tight.”
The man raised his handcuffed arms and scratched his head. The instant the eyes shining through his forearms shone sharply, he threw himself away without even warning.
When he swung his foot with the leaping power of the schema that surpassed even the weight of the iron ball, the iron ball was thrust right into Arcane’s face.
“Master!”
pop!
The man bent his knees and landed with a tired expression. He hit a person and this sound came out.
“Sheesh, that’s annoying magic.”
Arcane didn’t budge. The half of the face hit by the iron ball was covered with a black shadow. It was dark skin magic that absorbed shock by maximizing the absorption power of dark magic.
“It’s quite usable. You pass.”
As Arcane cast the power of darkness, a shadow rose from the floor and grabbed the man’s shackles and handcuffs.
“Don’t move. Your limbs might fly off.”
Before the man could reply, the shadow rose like a blade and spun rapidly. The chain broke in an instant, and the man’s skin was not damaged in the slightest. The limitless molding technique and delicate manipulation were the essence of dark magic.
“It would be nice to be free. follow me I have work for you to do.”
“Why are you doing this? Didn’t you ever say you’d join?”
The corners of the smiling man’s lips trembled.
You already know how strong your opponent is. But wouldn’t it be meaningless to have escaped if you were led like a cow?
“Money is what drives you. If you help me, you can touch a lot of money.”
It is common knowledge among common sense that wizards are rich.
Besides, men were also human beings who would do anything to make money, so there was no reason to refuse.
“Whoops, that’s a lot of money. If it’s an in-between amount, I’ll quit halfway.”
The man followed Arcane and left the prison. That’s how one prisoner escaped from Inferno.
* * *
Sirone and the others rented an inn after organizing the materials they had collected at the library in a notebook. After two days of discussion, we were able to outline the principles of the Photon Cannon.
“Why does mass exist?”
If there is no mass, nothing changes. And it was a good world in its own way. Isn’t it a big deal just because today is the same as yesterday?
But in the beginning there was mass. As if this world should be filled with some new things.
“Mass is not weight. Weight is a force that acts in the direction of gravity. There is no direction in space. So what is mass? cohesion? But I don’t think even that is a complete explanation.”
Nade asked.
“Then what do you think?”
The feeling in my head was clear. It was clear, but not clear.
“Existence.”
“huh?”
“Proof that you are in this space. Isn’t that what mass is?”
Life is the code of life only. Perhaps mass is the true proof of existence that is used throughout the universe.
“Hmm. I hear it and it seems so. Like the will or breath of the Creator, for example.”
Upon hearing Nade’s words, Iruki snapped her fingers.
“God Particles.”
“huh? what?”
“God Particles. isn’t it okay The particles Sirone discovered are called God Particles.”
“Oh, are you okay? Sirone, what do you think?”
Sirone always nodded. It was as if he had excavated something original rather than a word created by Yiruki, and he felt like it fit exactly into the omniscience he was feeling.
“I like it very much. And it matters.”
“that’s right. Because the wizard’s omnipotence is linked to feelings. It is better to use a name that you like.”
In that sense, God Particles was an excellent choice.
When the discussion was over, Iruki lay down on the bed. His eyeballs were about to fall out from digging through books all day.
“Whoa, let’s finish the analysis with this and go back to school tomorrow. Classes will start normally from the day after tomorrow, so let’s prepare our minds. Surely you haven’t forgotten your promise already?”
Nade chimed in.
“of course. Going up to Class Four this semester. From now on, I will study like crazy. In the worst-case scenario, Sirone could graduate first.”
Maybe.
At first, it was said as a joke, but Nade and Iruki’s faces became more and more serious.
At this rate, Sirone might graduate first. To that extent, the discovery of God Particles was a great achievement.
“Sirone, do you have any plans to attend one more year after graduation?”
“haha! What are you talking about? In the current situation, I am the one with the greatest chance of not keeping my promise. At least you guys are at the top.”
Sirone’s words were not wrong, but considering the growth rate alone, it was enough to make her feel a sense of crisis. It was a situation where a student who did not even know how to live was assuming graduation in half a year.
“I can’t sleep. I’ll study and sleep.”
“uh? That, then me too!”
When Iruki got up from bed and opened the book, Ned took a seat at a table in the corner and began to study.
Even if the end comes tomorrow, Sirone was dumbfounded when the friends who wanted to play and see each other burned their passion for learning. However, he looked at them with warm eyes.
‘I met some good friends.’
Sirone was the last of the three to open the book.

Kingdom Education Academic Society Teachers’ Society.
The Kingdom Academic Conference, hosted by the Teachers’ Association, was a place where social and cultural workers, such as magic schools, swordsmanship schools, monks of each denomination, schools, alchemy foundations, and the 99 elite artists gathered to present a vision of the kingdom.
Saad attended the academic conference as the representative of Alpheas Magic School. He was on the verge of losing his mind in a situation where discussions on the harmful effects and positive functions of injecting education continued for several days.
‘Oh, damn it. Don’t they even sleep? Let’s go home.’
I attended because I was caught in the lottery, but I really hated it. He was a bully from his school days, and he was self-willed and nabal, and he was careful that he had nothing to do with education.
The fact that there were many good female teachers was the only consolation. In particular, the woman sitting at the round table across from him was the perfect ideal type.
Everything was attractive, from the flowing blue hair to the playfulness that could not be hidden even in a suit.
‘It looks good. Did I say Ogent Reina?’
He was a member of the 99 members, the best group of artists in the kingdom, and was a musician who attended as a disciple of melodious pianist Merhen.
The discussion ended at 7pm.
When an evening party hosted by the Teachers’ Association was held, the enthusiasm for discussion disappeared like a lie. The attendees were busy sipping wine and interacting with people from various fields.
In particular, there were high-ranking figures around Reina that even those who were not interested in the Teachers’ Association would have heard of.
‘I guess the phrase ‘beauty is painful’ is used in times like this.’
Saad overheard their conversation as he waited for his turn to speak. Most of them were cringingly authoritative words or jokes.
Reina responded kindly without losing her kind smile. She was an unexpected figure to Sade. It was because she had a bright personality that did not match the notoriety of the 99 members.
Art is a technique to deal with emotions, so the power to dominate the public was not at a level that even those in power could ignore.
In particular, due to the nature of the critical function of art, there were quite a few stubborn people among artists.
However, Reina was happily hanging out with people from all walks of life as if she had nothing to do with those rumors.
‘Haa, it would have been nice if Shiina-sensei had only half of that personality.’
As I was sipping wine while thinking about that, Reina, who had finished the conversation, walked towards Sade.
“Hello, Mr. Sade.”
“Ah yes! what? But do you know me?”
“sure. You are a teacher at Alpheas Magic School. Ogent’s home is in Creas.”
“aha! Yes. I was blinking Nice to meet you.”
The two of them talked for a long time in the joy of the trend. As Saad predicted, Reina had a bright and fun personality.
“By the way, is Sirone doing well?”
“yes? How does Reina-san make Sirone? Oh, I see.”
Sade, who was the teacher for grading the entrance exam in Sirone, recalled that the Ogent family was written where he was from.
“Sirone was a guest of the Ogent family. As expected, you have an excellent eye for people. Sirone is doing well. Well, although she had an accident recently.”
“yes? Are you buying? What kind of accident?”
When Raina opened her eyes wide, Sade felt sorry for her. Her pride would crumple when she found out that the Ogent family’s pushy student had been suspended.
“Ahaha! No big deal. Since he is an outstanding student, even the smallest things are widely known. It’s an accident in that sense.”
“Aha, that was it.”
Reina let out a sigh of relief. Even after hearing Sade’s story, she could guess what kind of life Sirone was living.
“I’m glad you’re doing well. Do you have many friends?”
“Sure. It is popular with both men and women. Sometimes I’m too envious. ha ha ha!”
“Hoo. Then maybe… … .”
Reina, who was about to ask if she had a boyfriend, shook her head. As her supporter, it’s a question she can do enough. But the questioner in her mind was not only borrowing the name of her benefactor.
“yes? Any questions?”
“no. I’m glad you seem to be doing well.”
“haha! Do not worry. It’s hard to say this with my own mouth, but Alpheas Magic School is prestigious. You can leave it with peace of mind.”
“Huh, that’s right. I’m off topic. sorry.”
“no. Rather, I was c*cky. How about going to Creas with me? I’m planning to leave in the morning. I will treat you to a nice lunch.”
Reina shook her head with a sad expression.
“sorry. I think I will have to go back to Baska because the performance is scheduled.”
“Oh, I see. this… … .”
THAAD could not hide its regret. As usual, she would have let go without regret, but she was truly a woman to be missed.
“I can’t help it. But I really want to see the performance. Would you mind giving us your schedule? I will go to Baska.”
“Oh my, this is an honor. Actually, I was worried. I was wondering what to do if there are many vacancies because bad things happen in the capital.”
“Oh, what happened to Baska?”
“They say that a dark mage raided Inferno and escaped a Class B wanted man. Right now, the capital is in a state of security that is comparable to martial law.”
“dark… … Are you a wizard?”
Sade’s brow wrinkled. It may be one of many news, but if you think about it, it was a rare event.
Dark wizards are hard to find in the world these days. Besides, did you have to attack Inferno? And that’s just to get one Class B wanted out?
Dark Mage, Inferno, B-Class Wanted.
A scene from history passed through Sade’s mind.

“Huh!”
I felt the pain only after I had already flown 20 meters, and Jace desperately held on to the consciousness of moving away.
‘stop! Stop!’
I applied reverse thrust with blow-type magic, but my body bounced off the floor like a ball, only doubling the pain.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
It was the first time she realized that a person could roll for so long and so much.
It rolled endlessly, and no sign of stopping seemed to be waiting at a very distant point in time.
‘Die!’
You will roll and you will die.
The moment she heard a thunder and felt something break, a powerful force suddenly stopped her.
“Huh! Huh!”
Jace, who looked up at the spinning sky while holding her in her arms, focused on his body.
‘Three ribs, broken wrist, ruptured ankle ligaments.’
The moment I judged that far, what came to my mind was what kind of magic I was under.
‘It was just light.’
Information about God Particles is now quite well known, but Book Eymond was an exception.
‘There is no wizard like that here.’
If a 3rd-class archmage can be defeated by a single magic attack, then it should be a 1st-class wizard.
“You got it right. It must have been a good experience for you too.”
Minerva clicked her tongue and blew her witch’s breath into Jacey’s lips.
“iced coffee… … .”
I fell into ecstasy for a while, but when I came to my senses, the pain in my body was gone without a trace.
“It’s a level that has been put together. Do not fight.”
Jacey’s eyes widened.
“It can’t be! There are still thousands or tens of thousands of people to kill… … ! Keugh!”
Jace crouched down as his side ached.
‘Rage is beautiful.’
Minerva, who had been watching him lovingly, corrected her expression and stood up.
Sirone stood in front of him.
“What are you doing?”
“You know. If you still don’t know, you’re at a low level. North Eymond conducted experiments that were threatening to mankind.”
“So what are you going to do?”
“As you can see… … .”
Minerva introduced the scene where countless demons turned to ashes and disappeared.
“You have to finish one by one. Sooner or later North Eymond will disappear from the world map.”
Not revealing the room for compromise means that she also grasped the true nature of Igor.
“The same goes for Garas, but the control of the altar has already passed. See those demons? There are still huge numbers coming out. It’s hard to finish it unless it’s a genocide.”
“That is cruel. Even people who have nothing to do with it get caught up in it.”
“Of course it is. But it’s my job to minimize the damage. And to be honest… … .”
Minerva’s eyes changed.
“There is no human in the world who would feel unfair about being killed.”
“… … .”
“If you are strong, you can make a choice. either good or evil. But for the weak, the only weapon that can make them strong is evil. When you do something evil, people get scared. I wonder if I will suffer that kind of damage.”
Minerva’s smoking pipe pointed at Baseto.
“Do you know how different that guy is? If he had been as strong as you, he might have been worse than Igor. That nobody knows.”
I learned what kind of person Minerva was from the elevator in the Ivory Tower, and I learned why she became that way through the story of <Slaughter>.
Since compromise would be difficult, Sirone also spoke her own words.
“Stop the slaughter. From now on, I will take care of North Eymond.”
The person who didn’t want to do that the most was definitely Jacey, who came to Minerva’s side, clutching at her side.
“Were you acquainted?”
Surely that should be enough to not be ashamed of.
“Should I say we know each other? It’s a work colleague.”
“yes? A co-worker?”
After confirming where she worked, Jacey narrowed her eyes and looked back at Sirone.
“You mean that person is also a star?”
“okay. It’s embarrassing. If it was another star, I would kick it out, but he has the same rank as me.”
Same rank as Minerva.
“So, what about Oh Dae-seong?”
“okay. I’m the Human Security Enforcement Department, he’s the Integrated Space Management Department. But the problem is… … .”
The United Space Management Department has a little stronger attack on Taeseong.
Jacey, unaware of the fighting inside the ivory tower, was just interested in Sirone.
“I must have just turned twenty… … .”
Well, wasn’t Minerva actually over seven hundred years old?
“that’s right. He is twenty years old.”
Jacey looked back at Minerva with a puzzled expression, but she wasn’t joking.
“And mankind’s strongest wizard. No, second in the ranking?”
Minerva hinted at Nane’s existence and said with a playful smile.
“Yes, joint first place.”
“Don’t instigate childish fights. I’ll figure it out for you. The problem now is Mr. Minerva. Nothing is solved this way.”
“Then what are you going to do?”
“Dispel the disaster magic right now.”
The demons, second generation demons, and ordinary people were all dying from the deadly poisonous gas she scattered.
“Do you have <Spell>?”
Sirone frowned.
“Let’s make a deal. If <Law Killing> comes out, I will hand over this agenda to the United Space Management Department.”
“I can’t.”
“You’re going to hand it over to Kashan? It wouldn’t be an idle place to care about politics.”
“no. I have a feeling that if Mr. Minerva had this, he would suffer even more than he does now.”
The poisonous gas disappeared.
“Just because you sacrificed for everyone doesn’t mean you can protect everyone. Neither you nor I are gods. And no guffins. Even if you reach the realm of infinity, it is only human infinity.”
Minerva pointed to the battlefield.
“see? Even now, countless people are dying to the demons. You can beat them, but you can’t save them all! You, too, should stop being a petty god and make choices and focus!”
so it’s annoying
“To Nane, to Kashan, to the altar, to humans, to atrocities… … ! you can’t do it all! Right now, even the residents here can’t protect it!”
On the other side of the supply route, Verdi and his family shouted.
“dad! dad!”
“Verdi!”
Baseto threw himself away, and the demons chased after the family with scary weapons.
Simultaneously, the situation was analyzed.
The second generation of demons was massacring the garrison, and in the distance Godan, the commander of the 48th Military Facility, was slicing the workers with a sword.
said Minerva.
“This is reality! Killing them all minimizes damage! So leave it to me and get out!”
“What is reality?”
The moment of giving up is real.
“How do you know without trying?”
As Sirone focused her mind, the Spirit Zone grew to an unimaginable size and covered the military facility.
“Oh, this can’t be… … .”
In front of the spirit of Yahweh beyond human limits, Jaycee did not even dare to interfere.
‘Quantum Super Position!’
100,000 stacks.
A significantly higher number of sirones than when they explored Andre’s Labyrinth cast teleportation in all directions.
The flash that spread like an explosion was blinding, and countless people experienced the miracle at the same time.
“Great!”
Synesthesia, the five senses plus time, space, and mind, has been transmitted through the Spirit Zone.
That transcendent information analyzed every situation without any error and saved people who were on the verge of being attacked by demons.
“Damn Yahweh! Abominable Yahweh!”
In a situation where only the demons were annihilated, the second generation of the demons stopped their actions as if frightened.
“Ah, ah… … .”
Verdi shed tears as he looked up at the thousands of flashes of light parabolic in the sky.
I couldn’t analyze it with an adult’s head, but the emotions that filled my heart were no different.
“Huh! Whoa!”
save everyone
“My brother told me.”
At the 48th Military Facility, there are countless people who live and are treated as subhumans.
“You are the most valuable person in the world.”
When something that no one had attempted in human history became a reality, people knelt down one by one.
light embroidered the sky.
“What is that light?”
While everyone had the same question, the demons turning to ashes shouted.
“I hate Yahweh! I’ll tear the people you love to shreds! I will watch you shed tears of blood in hell!”
“Die, Yahweh! Be cursed, Yahweh!”
people muttered.
“Yahweh.”
A love that humans cannot do.
“Lord Yahweh… … .”
100,000 flashes of light created 10 million afterimages and covered the sky, and finally the whole world was filled with light.
Sirone knelt down and exhaled heavily.
“Huh! Huh!”
Looking back at the scene where all the demons had disappeared, Minerva fell into deep thought.
“It’s not over yet!”
What remains are a few second-generation demons.
Most of them suffered injuries that made them unable to move, but Commander Godan survived and charged towards Sirone.
“Magic.”
It was natural for them to hate Sirone, who had everything except love among human emotions.
“I will kill you, abominable… … !”
When Minerva held out her hand, the jet flew with tremendous acceleration and pierced Godan’s body.
“Gagging!”
As he toured the facility in that state and penetrated all the buildings called buildings, the high end finally drooped.
“… … Are you okay?”
Minerva, who had finished, approached Sirone, who was practicing mindless breathing.
Sirone raised her head without speaking.
“It’s as if the person who will answer is you.”
“I can do it. You may have your kar, but please leave this task to me.”
“We saved the 48th Military Facility.”
Minerva looked back at the tranquil landscape.
“Are you going to save the capital next? North Eymond further, the continent further, the East, the South… … .”
until when?
“Just because you did it today doesn’t mean that your karma has been implemented.”
“i know. but… … .”
Sirone looked back at Verdi, who was crying tears of joy as she hugged her family.
“Because it doesn’t matter.”
If one individual can save the whole on the condition of sacrificing everything… … .
‘I couldn’t do it, so I didn’t do it either. But if, really, if there was even a 1% chance of that… … .’
What better gamble could there be?
“Hey, on a topic that doesn’t even exist like Kar.”
Sirone smiled and stood up.
“Then are you entrusting it to me now?”
“What do you know? Anyway, if you’re black, it’s the Human Security Enforcement Department. What we got in return is recklessness.”
It was the department that killed the most people.
“I will also have <Swordsman>.”
As Sirone hammered the nail firmly, Minerva smiled and turned around.
“I can’t. Do you know how to use it?”
“yes? just… … Doesn’t it automatically activate when you put your earnest heart into it?”
“Otherwise it is. That would be enough to kill a badass bastard, but the opponent <Law Killing> will probably be on a different level this time.”
Sirone had not heard the news of the temple.
“The atrocity that the Empress of Kashan is watching is Gustav Havitz, 17 years old. He is the person who became Gustav’s emperor this time.”
“Three Emperors… … .”
“It should be quicker to understand that you know Uorin. Their skills are also not average. That means there will be a lot of stratagems to avoid the law of <Slaughter>.”
“okay.”
Sirone could not have imagined that the emperor would die.
‘Certainly so. To kill the emperor from North Eymond to Gustav’s palace, and from there again through numerous escorts… … .’
How can the alternative law be changed?

“The law of <Slaughter> is not omnipotent. Unless the opponent is also an idiot, he tries to avoid the law.”
said Minerva.
“Cause and effect interlock endlessly. Axing is twisting it to the extreme. But even if there is an axing that cuts everything, there is also an axing that blocks everything, right?”
Minerva crossed the index fingers of both hands.
“When they collide, a new law is born in which the two overlap.”
<Law Slaughter> should work in conjunction with the law of the target, not to enforce the law.
“Statistically, it takes four months on average to circle the planet.”
“what? Is it surprisingly fast?”
It was an incredibly fast trip around the world compared to having to bite the tail of causality.
Minerva agreed.
“huh. It’s a pretty powerful axing. However, in severe cases, it may take more than a year. For example, what if the target of <Slaughter> roams the world nonstop?”
It will be an endless chase.
“It actually happened. The subject was a diplomat. What I realized at that time is that no matter how fast the law of <Slaughter> is, it cannot be faster than the speed at which it moves to carry out a specific purpose. So what did I do?”
“You took it yourself.”
“answer. That’s why ‘reset’ is so important. After erasing the target, artificially designing the incident.”
“But is it possible? Even if the owner of <Slaughter> dies, the law has already been invoked, right?”
“There is one way. It’s what I call ‘retargeting,’ and you can use it to reset things.”
“Hmm.”
Sirone was lost in thought.
“It’s a very tricky weapon.”
“It is a characteristic of S-class objects. Rather than being difficult, it’s so effective that there’s a lot of room for maximization. Armand too? Just like anyone can be strong, but you have to understand it perfectly to function 100 percent.”
Sirone understands Armand perfectly.
‘And there is only one person in the world who can handle <Slaughter> the best… … .’
The creator of the weapon was Mirach Minerva.
“great. Let’s move together for a while. Please explain to Uorin if you ever need to use <Spell>.”
The Empress of Kashan would have designed the optimal method based on Minerva’s explanation.
Meanwhile, while Sirone and Minerva were talking about <Slaughter>, Jacey’s face was dazed.
“really… … Is it possible?”
Workers were enjoying a pleasant reunion with their families in the landscape where the demons were washed clean.
“Then why… … why the hell… … !”
Did my husband have to die
“If you have such a great ability! Why the hell! Why didn’t you save my husband!”
Hearing Jacey’s voice, Sirone turned her head, and Minerva’s eyes locked coldly.
‘Possibility… … .’
Just by showing the possibility of saving the whole, Sirone can be said to be close to a god.
‘But not everyone can be saved.’
In the end, someone will suffer, and that pain will endlessly circulate according to the fear of reincarnation.
‘I got caught this time… … .’
Minerva became a witch.
‘Tomorrow is you.’
If you have an incurable disease, suffered a natural disaster, or lost your life in an unexpected accident.
The life of a creature is to turn and stop the bomb named Pain, whose turn will be next.
So, watching from the end of time, this world is just full of pain… … .
still i am right
‘Those who think they’ve cast their lot right now won’t understand me… … .’
Jacey would have been too.
‘You know? Now Jaycee… … .’
And Minerva.
‘The fact that this world is so resentful.’
Jacey cried.
“Why me! why! Everyone else is happy, why am I the only one who has to suffer like this!”
Sirone bit his lip.
‘It’s because of me.’
It was the pain caused by blocking me, and the number of bombs would increase further in the future.
‘I want to become stronger.’
No, if only I could turn my heart around, even by begging on my knees.
However, knowing that this couldn’t be the case, Sirone terribly clenched her fists and made up her mind.
“It’s not your fault.”
Minerva put her hand on Sirone’s shoulder.
“It’s not even my fault.”
contradiction.
What happens when an all-cutting axing and an all-blocking axing collide?
The law says:
“It’s just the way it is.”
state of contradiction.
“Just because we can’t imagine it doesn’t mean there aren’t consequences. this is the result Accept it and move on.”
Minerva laid Jacey on her lap, who was crying until she was exhausted, and bit into a smoking pipe.
“Sleep for a while. This will help.”
Jacey’s pupils relaxed peacefully as the witch’s breath leaked through her lips.
“Because if we leave it as it is, we might make bad choices.”
Minerva, who had lifted Jacey up in the air with her magic, turned to Sirone and said.
“Let’s go to the capital. I have to finish this job.”
The witch’s broom jet swept away Godan’s corpse and flew quickly.
“Do you want to ride together?”
The seat seemed to be cramped because Jacey had to be picked up.
“no. Go away. I will follow you.”
Minerva laughed at the words that she would follow even though she knew it was a jet that was listed in the world record.
“good. If it’s too late, I’ll handle it my way?”
As soon as Minerva jumped up and landed on the jet, powerful gas was released and soared into the sky.
The sound of metal grinding followed by a sonic explosion, and Sirone turned to Verdi.
She nodded as if she understood what she wanted to say, then bowed deeply again.
‘thank you.’
Sirone, who had regained her composure, looked back at the sky and bent her knees.
broad interest.
As the wings of light spread tens of meters in length, the eyes of the people watching widened.
“Uh-oh… … .”
If it was just to fly, it would have exceeded its capacity, but it had to be this much to follow Minerva.
As everyone looked up at the pair of wings soaring into the sky, the light descended at a terrifying speed.
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
A roar erupted, and Sirone’s body disappeared through the clouds in less than a second.
“oh my god… … .”
Moments later, another sonic explosion erupted.
‘It’s too fast. I’m flying at Mach too.’
Each time the wings hit the air, Sirone’s body was pushed forward hundreds of meters.
It was only after doubling the cycle that I was able to capture the smoke created by the jet’s flames in the distance.
“oh? Did you really follow me?”
Minerva looked around and waved, as if meeting an acquaintance in passing.
It was no longer in a situation where their voices could be transmitted, and Sirone and Minerva read each other’s lips and chatted.
“Are you going to take me?”
Jacey was hanging like laundry and looked like it was about to fall.
“don’t worry. Surprisingly, the ride feels good. Jaycee… … .”
Minerva looked down at the swift-flowing mountain landscape and broke the Law of Jet.
“I can leave it here.”
Sirone hurriedly turned his head, but Jacey was already visible as a dot in the distance.
“… … Are you okay?”
“Who do you think I am?”
Sirone, speechless, looked back, but Minerva increased the thrust of the jet.
“The loser grants the wish.”
As the jet stretched 10 meters in length, Minerva gradually began to overtake Sirone.
“I will listen to anything.”
As she flinched and bounced forward as if she had disappeared, Sirone’s sympathy also boiled over.
“Yes, this is it… … .”
I didn’t have any particular wish, but I desperately wanted to avoid the situation of granting her wish.
As the mass of the light wing increased, it hit the atmosphere with solid strength, and Sirone’s body was shot like a cannon.
‘Hey there!’
The capital of North Eymond came into view.
* * *
the capital city of Parsia.
The Sujanggung, where the president resided, was a multi-purpose fortress with 780 buildings all connected.
Revolution Square was one of the largest man-made structures in the world and could accommodate all of the capital’s 3 million people.
Putting it in is probably accurate, but Igor thought that everyone in the country should praise him directly.
Of course, it was the case of the human Igor, but that idea was still valid even after the governor was changed to a demon.
“Commander, preparations are complete.”
Commander of the 24th Corps, Maraduk of Ruin.
He was a man with a beautiful appearance that caught the attention of many women, and light purple hair that came down to his shoulders.
Golden patterns were engraved along the rim of the black armor that adhered to the body, and on the left side of the throne, a sword was leaning toward its owner.
“How long have you been together?”
“The total number of troops who have escaped from the psychic realm is 8 million.”
It was a number that corresponds to dozens of times the army of one country, but considering that Satan’s army is 2 billion, it was not even a corps level.
“Enough to hit a human.”
When Maradouk came down the stairs with the sword attached to his waist, the four division commanders all retreated left and right.
The room was completely soundproofed, but the windows were vibrating due to the shouts outside.
“I will be the vanguard and destroy the world.”
As soon as I opened the window, the blocked sound came in like a cannon.
“Kill the human! Kill humans!”
An army of 8 million spread out beyond the Chieftain’s Palace was roaring with evil.
Sirone looked down at the scene of Pasia.
“… … What is that?”
While most of the streets were empty, more demons than ants swarmed on the side of the chief palace.
said Minerva.
“I guess the capital is over. I can’t even see the resistance. The Capital Defense Forces must have already been destroyed.”
“Are there any survivors?”
“Maybe. But it won’t be on the side of the chief palace. If someone got in there, they would be eaten right away.”
“I need to find survivors.”
“That’s a good choice too. But now is not the time. Things get complicated when the second generation of demons from the chief palace cross the border.”
It will infiltrate into society and move covertly.
“It would have been possible to experiment because it was a closed society, but that’s why we also have a chance. Let’s hit it.”
“You want to play?”
The number of troops gathered in the Chief Palace seemed to easily exceed 5 million even when checked in terms of unit area.
“Where are you going to start?”
Minerva bent her index finger.
“Peck.”
As Sirone turned her gaze to the tips of her fingers, Minerva’s body floated and left the jet.
“Everything from start to finish.”
When Minerva’s body resisted, the jet moved ahead and rushed toward the entrance of the Longbow.
‘Are you really doing it?’
Dealing with an army of 8 million alone was impossible with human common sense.
“Wake! Go right away!”
Although it broke away from the jet, the tremendous inertia still led Minerva’s body toward the eldest arch.
Hey hey hey!
The demons at the entrance looked up at the sky at the sound of the gong of Mach’s speed.
“A surprise… … !”
Before the words could be finished, the jet crashed and the second generation of demons in the area soared into the sky.
“Kuaaaaa!”
remaining troops.
7,999,954 (7,999,954) people.

[762] Lord of Ruin (1)
Minerva, flying toward the entrance of the Chief Palace, turned to Sirone and said.
“Did I win?”
Jet arrived first, but Sirone was already fully focused on the battle.
“I will take over as the captain.”
“As you like. But going will not be easy.”
Without answering, Sirone fluttered her wings and moved away toward the end of the long palace, and Minerva landed at the entrance.
As soon as she pulled out the jet inserted in an oblique line, a terrifying poison spread from her body.
“Now, shall we start cleaning?”
Piercing through the deadly poison, 2-meter-tall, muscular demons surrounded her.
“I’ll chew you alive!”
Even in the midst of rotting flesh, the demons were fearless, and that’s why an army of 8 million was the strongest of 8 million.
‘Honestly, I’m a little embarrassed.’
A hard smile formed on Minerva’s lips.
The land area of the chief palace where the dictator’s greed permeated was one of the few in the world.
Ignoring all the demons teeming on the ground, Sirone headed for the leader’s palace.
‘I have no choice but to catch the captain.’
8 million.
It’s easy to say, but how many humans can accurately imagine an army of 8 million?
In addition, those on the ground now were demons with armed forces that were far higher than the average human.
‘Maybe from the beginning… … .’
I had a sudden thought.
‘Isn’t it a war that can’t be won?’
Satan’s army of 2 billion meant that if one demon killed two humans, the entire world’s population would be annihilated.
It was terrifying to think what would have happened if Shion hadn’t reduced the psychic realm.
“what?”
An ominous flame blazed across the sky in the orbit of Sirone’s flight.
“Geuuuuuu”
As the space opened, an insect-eaten face appeared in the real world.
Company commander Renault.
As a Demon that transports the troops of Hell, it can hold 400 Demons in its mouth.
“Yahweh… … !”
Seeing the demons swarming in her open mouth, Sirone’s face contorted.
‘Broad!’
As the curtain of light pulsated explosively and dug into her mouth, the screams of the demons blinded her eardrums.
“Kiyaaaaa!”
The field of view filled with blood and flesh suddenly burst open, and demons exploded like fireworks.
Remaining troops, 7,999,231.
… … There is no end.
In an instant, 400 demons were blown up in the air, but none of the demons felt a sense of loss.
‘I’m tired of it… … .’
Yahweh loves everything that exists and therefore transcends good and evil… … .
Demons have no mercy.
‘Ataraxia!’
As the huge Halo was born, colorful information began pouring like crazy.
At the same time as the start, Sirone aimed the completed magic circle at the ground and fired a photon cannon.
Aaaaaaang!
As the air roared, a flash of light dozens of meters in diameter was pierced diagonally, scratching the ground in that state.
“Quaaaaaaaa!”
Demons far stronger than humans sprang out in all directions, but they could not exceed Sirone’s scale.
273, 398, 113, 198… … The average number of demons dying per second reached about 200.
By the time the amplification of the flash ended, the casualties of the demons had exceeded 2,000, and Brigade Commander Sodas looked up into the sky.
“beautiful… … .”
Remaining troops, 7,996,973.
“I’m going to really go crazy.”
Sirone put on a tired expression.
It didn’t feel like it had diminished, and Minerva was worried when she felt the strength of the overwhelming number of troops she had actually experienced.
I looked back toward the entrance of the Chief Palace, but what caught my eye was a colony of demons of different heights.
In some places, I saw things over 10 meters.
‘Can I really do it?’
While Sirone was deep in thought, the 44th Brigade, 7th Division, 24th Corps all looked up at the sky.
“There is Yahweh! Shoot!”
As the hairless, snub-nosed devils opened their mouths so much that their jaws fell out, filth shot out in a net.
‘Destroy the horse!’
As Yahweh’s light expanded in the form of the Spirit Zone, the toxic filth turned to ashes.
Minerva was worried.
‘Just once, let’s do it just once.’
The limit of Quantum Super Position that Sirone, who has reached the level of Yahweh, can play at the same time is 100,000.
‘I don’t have a chin with this.’
When all of them cast Angel’s Punishment, the weakening of the army will be visible.
‘Just a moment.’
The problem was that the safety of the main body performing the quantum superposition could not be guaranteed, but Minerva would not be able to last long anyway.
‘Quantum Super Position!’
100,000 stacks.
In an instant, her mind spun around, and Sirone’s body fell to the ground at a terrifying speed.
Blocking the impact of landing is all the magic the body can do.
“Now!”
100,000 sirones turned into flashes of light and soared into the sky, raising the incarnation of an archangel.
At the same time, Brigadier Sodas hugged Sirone’s body.
“Got it!”
Incarnation – Angelic Punishment.
Remaining troops, 5,668,227 men.
All the demons lost their hearing as the longbow was adorned with a scene that looked like a shower of light.
Remaining troops, 4,340,976 men.
I couldn’t tell how loud the roar was, and I just realized that a catastrophic impact had occurred on the ground.
Remaining troops, 3,365,763.
“Kuaaa!”
As the cycle progressed, the number of deaths decreased, but there was already a space in the square like circular hair loss.
“Keugh!”
Sodas squeezed Sirone’s neck with both hands, and 100,000 sirone stopped firing at the same time.
‘I was aiming for an exact gap.’
It wasn’t that I couldn’t detect the approach to the spirit zone, but my thoughts couldn’t keep up.
‘strong.’
And it was beautiful.
It had a neat face that could not be thought of as a devil, and a fresh fruit-like scent emanated from its skin.
“What are you doing? continue.”
Sirone frowned.
“… … what?”
Sodas pressed his body tightly and put one hand down to sweep his chest.
“I will protect you, so kill them all.”
This time, I was suspicious of what the intention was, but Sodas’ eyes did not waver.
“Anyway, brigade commanders won’t be defeated, and the rest of them will be reborn as many times as they like.”
It will be as long as humans don’t give up on demons.
“But they are your men.”
Tears flowed from Sodas’ eyes.
“Actually I… … I want to repent. Living as a demon is terrible now. So please… … Give me one chance… … .”
‘I always say that.’
But Igor said:
– It is not that there are no penitent demons at all.
“This is the last time. If my filthy body can be purified with your light, maybe I too… … .”
Sodas’ eyes went up.
“Ah, this is the body of Yahweh… … .”
Unlike lowering his hand, Soda’s power was applied to his right hand holding his neck.
‘die!’
Just when he was about to break Sirone’s neck.
“Huh!”
As the light of Yahweh spread, the hand that grasped the neck turned into ashes and began to scatter.
“Huhhhhh!”
The Quantum Super Position had already been unlocked.
“also… … .”
Sodas, who was suffering from Sirone’s voice, looked down with difficulty.
“You lied.”
Is there anyone in the world who would believe a swindler with 20 criminal convictions?
‘The devil repents?’
parents believe
If you pray with tears in your eyes, saying, “Mom, I won’t do that again,” you have no choice but to believe whether you have a criminal record of 20 or 200.
‘It can change, this time it’s real… … .’
That’s why Sirone was rather sad even while extinguishing the demon, a sick child of a human who could never change.
“no.”
Sodas looked down at Sirone with sorrowful eyes and stroked his face with a hand that was turning to ashes.
“I was really trying to do penance.”
“Aaaaaaa!”
As the light of Yahweh spread, Sodas and all the demons around were burned.
“Huh! Huh!”
Even while stabilizing the mind with the breathing method of free mind, the enemies were endlessly rolling in.
“Is it worth it?”
When the kneeling Sirone looked back, Minerva had arrived behind her.
She also clearly looked tired, and her clothes, which had been ripped off by demons, were tattered.
Superqualifier’s senses can treat the mind like matter, and Sirone quickly regains her composure.
“till now. How is Minerva?”
“Me too… … so so.”
It wasn’t the time to fight.
“Please protect me. If you activate the Quantum Super Position again and wipe out the demons… … .”
“It’s no use. still don’t know Yahweh’s light itself becomes a powerful weapon against the demons… … .”
Minerva pointed the smoking pipe forward.
“That’s because demons are non-entities. It will take its own blows, but in the end, it’s just a matter of time.
“So you mean leave me alone?”
“no.”
said Minerva, puffing out green smoke.
“There are ways to be a little more constructive.”
Sirone, who blocked the smoke from coming, inflicted angelic punishment on enemies in all directions.
“What are you going to do?”
Remaining troops, 3,363,305 men.
“I’m going to use the forbidden technique.”
Sirone was already anxious.
“If it is banned, we must keep it. What forbidden technique is it that can be used so easily?”
“The United Space Management Department will take responsibility. Even if you don’t believe me, if Taeseong is you, it’s terrible. In return, I’ll give you three wish veto tickets.”
“It is not subject to compromise.”
“okay?”
Minerva inhaled deeply.
“Then what are you going to be punished for?”
Calamity Magic – The Walking Dead.
As she puffed out her cheeks and exhaled, moving her head from left to right, a cloud of green smoke rose.
“What the hell people say… … .”
“I already did it.”
After assessing the situation at Minerva’s words, Sirone hurriedly looked around.
“Ahhh… … .”
Dozens of demons in charge of acting stood for a while with stupidly relaxed pupils, then suddenly became violent.
However, the target they were attacking was not Minerva, but the demons right next to them.
“What is this… … .”
Minerva explained.
“The art of fratricide, The Walking Dead. When poisoned, there is only enmity against one’s own people. They lose consciousness, but they don’t die unless their heads are blown off.”
“The Walking Dead.”
It was the name of a terrible disaster recorded in history books.
“okay. And the true horror of this masterpiece… … .”
Minerva said, revealing that she would live.
“It is an infection.”
Number of infected: 48.
“Krrrr… … Aaaaaa!”
The demon who was bitten by the demon flipped its eyes and bit another demon next to it.
Number of infected: 127.
“Follow me. We enter the leader’s palace like this.”
As the demons started attacking the allies, the gap between the clearings around Minerva gradually began to increase.
“you idiot! Why are you biting us!”
Number of infected: 897 people.
Sirone looked at the Archwitch’s back as they walked along the road that widened by itself.
‘Mirac Minerva.’
Oh Dae-seong of the Human Security Enforcement Department, but perhaps she could be said to be a walking disaster.
“Those who side with humans are not demons!”
Number of infected: 2,483.
“Whoops, will it be that easy?”
The higher the population density, the greater the power of infection.
“Aww! no! I’d rather kill you!”
The worst fire, which had already driven mankind to the brink of extinction before Nane, was spreading in the Chieftain’s Palace.
Number of infected: 6,323.

[763] Lord of Ruin (2)
* * *
“Brigade commander.”
Besium, the 7th division commander belonging to the 24th Corps, approached with a clap of black iron armor.
“Soldiers are attacking our allies.”
Maraduk of Ruin, a beautiful man, sat on a throne and smiled lightly.
“Can you stop it?”
Besium immediately prostrated himself.
“Just leave it to me!”
“Hmm.”
When Maraduk rose from his seat, the three division commanders who were standing besides Besium saluted.
“This is an interesting ability. It’s an infection… … .”
The sight that Maradouk looked down through the window was a huge wave with no personality.
“Aww! die! Just die!”
Number of infected: 165,843.
Maraduk laughed while exposing his fangs as he watched the walking dead demons massacre their own people.
“Isn’t it really the devil?”
Savoring the irony, the four division commanders silently watched the scene outside the window.
Number of infected: 325,574.
The infection route created on a scale of 1 million units was pushing toward the leader’s palace, causing huge ripples.
“Clean it up.”
Maradouk made a firm decision.
“They are useless.”
It was already an irreversible situation, and when the number of infected people exceeds 1 million, the division commander gets tired from then on.
“I will follow your orders.”
While walking in the middle of the battlefield, Sirone and Minerva caught sight of the leader’s palace in the distance.
“Determine yourself! Kill yourself as soon as you get bitten!”
Hell’s brigade commanders put a bluff, but the chain of command was no longer in a situation to work.
Some demons took their own lives, but the statistics always converged to the average, and as the demons who missed the opportunity attacked the surroundings again, the infection grew like a snowball.
Number of infected: 653,329.
Sirone gulped as she walked along the path opened by the army of hell.
‘it’s over. It’s a terrifying magic.’
It benefited from a high population density, but even if it were dispersed, annihilation would have been a matter of time.
So my heart ached.
‘The magic of fratricide.’
When Minerva first revealed this magic to the world, humanity was on the brink of extinction.
‘Originally, to get rid of humans.’
How terrible must be human hatred for this kind of magic to be realized in the world?
“Don’t be like that.”
Minerva, who was blowing out cigarette smoke, said with a grin and tearing the corners of her mouth.
“It’s embarrassing to praise you like that.”
“… … .”
Just when Sirone was lost in thought, an explosion occurred in the leader’s palace.
“Looks like you finally realized that your ass was on fire.”
There were four people who radiated purple energy that was so vivid that you could see it where Minerva pointed the pipe.
“I’m the division commander.”
At the same time as he finished speaking, the demon in black iron armor took a step forward and swung his sword.
“The pitiful things.”
The trail of the sword, which should have ended as an afterimage, still remained in the space, wriggling, and then spread out, causing a huge ripple.
“Aaaaaaa!”
The number of demons cut by the single sword exceeded 300, and other division commanders also began to eliminate allies.
“It’s a counter-fire operation.”
If you remove the infected in advance, you can at least prevent the demons from flooding into the leader’s palace.
“A demonic judgment. But I can’t stop it anyway.”
The number of infected people has already exceeded the number of non-infected people.
“I can buy time. Look over there.”
Pointing to the top of the Leader’s Palace, Maradouk, the commander of the 24th Corps, was looking down at them with a displeased face.
“You look good.”
Minerva’s voice was as cold as ice.
“I will be strong.”
There was no room for objection, the demonic energy was burning like a flame.
“I will take over as the corps commander. You clear this up.”
Sirone shook her head.
“no. This is my job. I will take down the corps commander, so please take the division commander’s side.”
Minerva burst into laughter.
“Have you ever fought a corps commander?”
There was no
“You know how strong the division commander is. But the corps commander is not at that level. The best masterpiece that can be created through the condensation of demons.”
It reminded me of how Igor, the lord of terror, harassed the mercenaries with ‘brains in a vat’ in Radum.
“The army of hell was born when the individuality of Satan melted into the raw material called demon. Especially from the division commander level and above, the bizarre personality goes beyond common sense. It’s a different matter from what I’m right about.”
Satan was a being outside the law.
“The reason Nane’s sermon is powerful is that it is right after all. His tongue becomes the sword of truth and pierces the world. On the other hand, the reason your Yahweh is powerful is because it makes the wrong not wrong.”
All the laws love Sirone.
“That’s the Infinite Wizard. All imaginable things are realized through the light of Yahweh. Are you a newbie then?”
not god
“You only use the power of a god, but you are a human. God doesn’t imagine. He is everything he made.”
If it was really God, Jacey wouldn’t have accepted the world as suffering.
“You’re bragging, but you’re strong. Clearly, the only thing that can stop my huge rightness is your infinity. But it is also a battle of scalability. In terms of depth… … .”
It was a firm voice.
“I don’t think your realm is deeper than Miro or Veron. At least not yet.”
that’s also true.
“You are twenty years old now. You follow your judgment because you see the potential, not because you believe you can save the whole thing right now. Isn’t Jace’s job like that too?”
While all demons except for a few commanders were infected, Minerva moved on.
“Leave it to me. I’ll ask your back.”
Sirone put his hand on Minerva’s shoulder.
“Please let me do it.”
“… … This is not a bet. If you die, humanity is over. It doesn’t matter to me.”
“I don’t die. Nothing can be saved by death.”
Minerva clicked her tongue and turned around.
“do whatever you want. The world you saved anyway, whether you boil porridge or poison yourself… … .”
“Do not worry. Because in Heaven, I survived even against the archangels.”
Minerva smiled bitterly.
“Angels who can’t abort (system destruction)… … .”
“Apostasy?”
“I am the master of the system called Anke. I mean, no owner allows you to set your own house on fire.”
“I do not understand.”
“Listen to Taesung for details. Why did Anchera have no choice but to seal Ymir… … .”
Minerva, who swung the jet, bent her lower body and assumed a posture to jump out.
“I won’t stop you if you do, but you better be careful. The commander of the corps stands against Yahweh.”
As Minerva rode the jet and rushed forward, Sirone put her doubts aside for the moment and threw herself away.
‘If you defeat the corps commander, the war will end.’
As soon as he flapped his wings, he arrived at the spire of the leader’s palace where Maraduk was located.
An explosion erupted where Minerva was, but without even having time to look back, Maraduk took off.
“Is it Yahweh?”
The corps commander’s sword was erected vertically, and black energy covered the blade along the handle.
‘Dangerous.’
As Maradouk’s sword swung the landscape in half, a line 10 meters thick stretched out to the horizon.
“What is that?”
Shirone, who left her seat using the sense of time, climbed the spire on the other side and observed the ground.
There was no sound, no shock.
The straight line, as if drawn with a ruler, was a deep furrow whose depth could not be guessed.
‘How deep is it?’
One kilometer, ten kilometres, maybe more.
“It’s troublesome if you’re surprised already.”
Where Sirone slowly turned his head, Maraduk was floating a black sphere above his right hand.
“The Demon of Destruction.”
The oily orb crashed through the ceiling of the leader’s palace.
“… … .”
When I checked the inside of the palace as a spirit zone, the spheres that penetrated successive floors pierced the ground.
‘It keeps falling.’
It was a physically impossible phenomenon.
“don’t worry. It cannot pierce the stars.”
Sirone looked back at Maradouk.
“just… … It only hurts a little.”
He was different from me because he was free from the law, and even an infinite wizard had no choice but to squeeze his imagination.
‘How should I stop it?’
* * *
Taeseong crouched down with a painful expression on his face.
“Huh!”
The formidable shock applied to the stars was being transmitted to her body.
“Are you okay?”
Another member of the Five Greats who was invited to the Great Earth Temple, St. Mahoro Amanta, approached.
The tallest star in the Balance Department, he was a slender man with bald hair, brown skin and wrinkled eyes.
As the wheel he was holding between his thumb and forefinger turned rapidly with the sound of a spring, Taeseong’s eyes turned to it.
‘World wheel.’
The meaning of Mahoro was ‘the one who turns the world wheel’, and the sound of the spring was a sign that he would step out if necessary.
Taesung smiled.
“Do not worry. It doesn’t break down to this extent.”
A very long time ago, even when an asteroid collided, it was Taeseong that confidently overcame it.
“Yeah, that’s right. Even if demons and the like are planning a breakup, transcending full moon (overclocking) is a long way off. However, it means that Taeseong does not have to endure pain needlessly.”
Amanta only pursues moderation, and in that sense, the demon’s current move had a feeling that it went too far.
“You speak like Terraforce.”
“… … It’s the same philosophy. You can’t exist if you don’t follow the rules. I am neither on the side of demons nor on the side of humans.”
The sad face of Taeseong was put in between the wheels of the fast-turning world wheel.
“I just hope I don’t make you sadder.”
As Amanta gripped the World Ring in her hand, she realized how quiet the Earth Temple could be.
“Please pay respect.”
After Amanta disappeared, Taeseong looked back at the scene of North Eymond reflected on the ceiling.
“Sirone… … .”
The day of judgment was approaching.
* * *
‘Angel’s Punishment!’
Hundreds of archangels of light threw the spears of light at the same time, devastating the ground.
The leader’s palace had already lost its shape, and the capital, filled with the dictator’s greed, was reminiscent of a wasteland.
‘I can’t catch it.’
Maraduk’s sword caused afterimages, and each time it was cut, numerous Sirone’s heads fell off.
All of them are sirones, but they sacrificed themselves with the determination to protect their bodies.
The problem was the energy of destruction that Maraduk’s sword sprayed like ink, and it was disappearing as soon as it touched any substance.
‘Homing Photon Cannon!’
As many as two hundred homing photon cannons drew a parabolic arc and attacked Maraduk, but he had no reason to move.
“The Veil of Ruin.”
The photon cannon dissipated in a silent ripple of light as black liquid covered Maraduk.
“I misjudged.”
Maraduk dropped his sword to his side, poised to swing it wide.
“It wasn’t even a plaything.”
As the swordsmanship of the great annihilation unfolded, black liquid was sprayed in all directions in a huge line.
‘Poetry of fire!’
After penetrating the trajectory of the line using the sense of time, Sirone entered the other side of the world through Choeni Bardo.
‘That’s it!’
If it was a phenomenon that ignores physics, it could only be an ability that was activated in Park Ji’s realm.
As expected, the black liquid was flying while encroaching on the other side of the world, but the shape was different from the real world.
“What the hell is this?”
I was able to feel it as a spirit zone thanks to the time I earned by making a shield out of materials.
Tiny creatures were gnawing at the iron.
‘It’s nano.’
Because there were so many of them, it took only an instant for the iron to disintegrate, and Sirone hurriedly threw herself away.
“Do you think knowing will make a difference?”
Maraduk, who tracked the location of Sirone who touched the nano weapon, swung his sword in the real world.
“Of course it will change.”
Amgu.
“100,000 stacks.”
A black hole with a gravitational field with a radius of 8 meters was born as the particles of God were compressed terribly.
Key eh eh eh!
As the black liquid drawn in a parabolic curve was sucked into a spiral, a goosebumps scream erupted.

[764] Lord of Ruin (3)
‘They’re really nasty guys.’
The name of the nanobody led by Maraduk is ‘Small Force’, and it was a scavenger of the underworld where microbes could not exist.
‘An existence outside the law.’
The reason why demons are not bound by the law is because they belong to the psychic realm created by humans.
Maraduk’s demonic energy, which seemed to ignore physical force, was also a small power that worked in the other world.
‘If I couldn’t block it with the password… … .’
would have died
“Whoa!”
As the choeni bardo was released, the scenery of the other world burned like a piece of paper on fire.
Maraduk stood solemnly in the ruins that humans would have to fight for a month to create.
“… … It was an excellent decision.”
Sirone glared at Maraduk, but the aftermath of 100,000 stacked Quantum Super Positions disturbed her mind.
‘It’s really hard to get past this point. It’s better to think of it as the limit of what’s currently available.’
The only way to maintain character in an infinitely spread mind is to drop the Kar value to an extreme level.
‘The depth of the realm.’
If Miro or Veron had reached the realm of Yahweh, it wouldn’t have been this far.
‘Why am I so shallow?’
Even planning 100,000 cases was no longer a human category, but Sirone felt sorry for her.
“The only thing that can prevent ruin is extinction.”
Maraduk walked with his sword hanging down.
“Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!”
The sound of laughter was terribly unpleasant, but Sirone, whose mind was not yet stable, was able to buy time.
“Is this Yahweh?”
As soon as the laughter stopped, a terrifying black flame rose from Maraduk’s body.
“With this kind of light… … .”
Maraduk, who evaporated his body, swung his sword right in front of Sirone’s eyes.
“No demon repents.”
Sirone did not react.
‘Still in my mind… … .’
The reason why I added 100,000 overlaps to the dark sphere was because I just needed a gravitational field size of 8 meters.
‘Valhalla action!’
As the number of incidents increases, control becomes more difficult, so the concentration of power inevitably falls.
‘Calculation impossible!’
However, this was also an efficiency worthy of Sirone.
‘Valhalla action!’
potential for perfection.
It was the unique personality that if all variables could be eliminated, it would be the fastest and most powerful to be perfect.
‘done!’
Perhaps that’s why he reached the limitless state.
“ha! ha!”
What remains for those who have continued to be perfect, and reached this position by surpassing that perfection again… … .
“You speak interesting laws.”
What is it?
“Certainly not human.”
Maraduk looked at the magic circle of Valhalla action floating above Sirone’s head with interest.
‘Calculation is impossible.’
Since the devil is out of the law, the Valhalla action could not suggest an equivalent exchange.
‘All I could do was avoid it.’
The second calculation Sirone tried was just avoiding the seat.
‘Even if I don’t have any ability, I’m just strong.’
In return for avoiding Maraduk’s sword, the exchange was a delay of 1.87 seconds even with Sirone’s level.
-Angels that cannot be abrogated.
Minerva’s words finally made sense.
‘Ataraxia, Valhalla action. It is the extreme of the law that can be created with the senses of an angel… … ,’
The demons were beings that were in conflict with the law.
‘So chaos.’
Maraduk pounced.
“What do you want?”
It was not at a level that could be smoothed out with a sense of time, so Sirone restarted the Valhalla action.
“Huh!”
The distance of 16.7 meters, which was moved while ignoring time, required a suspension of 4.3 seconds.
“Human Happiness?”
Maraduk rather seemed to enjoy it and leisurely pursued Sirone and threw himself.
‘I can’t avoid it forever!’
Like compound interest, each time the Valhalla action was linked, the amount of time Sirone had to pay was increasing.
However, if he didn’t avoid it right away, he would be cut off by Maraduk’s sword, so he had no choice but to pay back endless debts to stop it.
“You have succeeded, Yahweh.”
Black smoke billowed from his body as Maraduk gathered all the powers of the Underworld.
“To make the devil feel pity.”
As the demonic energy called the Great Annihilation raged, it encroached on a radius of 4 kilometers from where Sirone was.
There was no sound, but all the zones for a small village had disappeared from the world.
“Big!”
At a place 4 kilometers away, Sirone was crouching and unable to do anything.
“Pain and pleasure are sensations, but… … .”
Maraduk approached in an instant.
“Where does happiness come from?”
Knowing that there was no turning back, Sirone cast Quantum Super Position as a Valhalla action.
Thousands of sirones moved, but it was not an opponent to overwhelm with numerical superiority.
“Even if you’ve struggled like this… … .”
Every time Maraduk wielded his sword like mad, countless events were extinguished.
“Can’t you find something that isn’t there?”
Maraduk, who moved faster than the sense of time and grabbed the alter ego, stabbed Sirone in the middle of the forehead.
‘are you okay. It’s not the main body.’
The moment the cold sensation penetrated her forehead, Sirone’s life was cut off.
“Quaaaaagh!”
The sharp tip of Jet’s spear entered division commander Besium’s mouth, pierced the back of his head, and stuck to the ground.
“Ahhh… … !”
Minerva, who had already dealt with the other three division commanders, put her butt against the collapsed wall while holding onto Jet’s rod.
“Whoa.”
Blood flowed from his lips, and his clothes flowed like rags, revealing his inner flesh.
Bethum said with the jet in her mouth.
“… … You are strong.”
Even from the perspective of the demons, I couldn’t think of them as human beings.
“It is not strong.”
Minerva, who tore the clothes around her waist, stopped the blood flowing from her shoulders and said.
“It’s just a good fight.”
“… … .”
Besium, savoring her words, turned her gaze to watch the battle between Sirone and Maraduk.
“Why don’t you kill me?”
“I will kill you. If you feel like it.”
“Aren’t you making excuses?”
“excuse?”
Bethum’s mouth was torn with his jaw parted open.
“Because you won’t be able to defeat our corps commander either. Are you going to save your life by doing what you had to do?”
Minerva’s eyes pierced Maraduk.
“… … I will not deny it.”
You don’t have to risk your life.
“But to be honest, I feel bad. just… … If you are looking at that child.”
“Yahweh is unlucky.”
Minerva laughed.
“ha ha ha! that’s right. The one who dies The one who dies and the one who lives Isn’t living life? That, in another sense, is mysophobia.”
“You like him.”
Minerva leaned her forehead against the jet and looked down.
“Why do you think so?”
“There are only two types of people who deny Yahweh. Hate terribly, or love terribly.”
“Don’t you think it would be the former?”
“It’s the same thing anyway.”
The demons… … Why do you hate Yahweh?
“Whoops, it’s because you’re the division commander, right?”
As Minerva grabbed Jet and spun it around, Bessum trembled in pain.
“Big uh… … .”
Taking her hand off the jet, Minerva bit into the smoking pipe.
“Everyone wants to be perfect in the beginning.”
Savoring the pain’s departure, Bessum turned her pupils back to the sky.
“Anyone can do as little as arranging a pencil. And that’s what you think. beautiful.”
Minerva’s smoking pipe drew pictures in the air.
“That’s how the journey to perfection begins. Build a house, increase the number of floors, I should be happy, there should be no flaws in my life.”
The painting was released into smoke and collapsed.
“Then one day I suddenly realized. Can it really be perfect?”
“Humans are stupid.”
“that’s right. Only the desire for perfection remains and the self disappears. I just have to give up a little bit and live.”
Minerva turned to Sirone.
“If you think that there can be no pain in the world, you must be mysophobia.”
The 2,458th Sirone stabbed by Maradouk’s sword died in agony.
‘are you okay. Because I’m not the main body.’
In fact, everyone is sirone.
“That’s why I’m angry. The heart of Yahweh who loves the whole is noble, but… … .”
Minerva’s cigarette smoke drifted long.
“Sirone, where are you in the whole thing?”
Maraduk, who had cut off all of Sirone, finally grabbed the main body by the neck and lifted it up.
“Keukkeu, laughing Yahweh.”
Minerva shook her head.
“That’s why you can’t win.”
If it is a fraternity that cannot love itself, that would also be arrogance for sacrifice.
“Because of our obsession with perfection, everything falls apart with impossible odds.”
Sirone is strong, but not a good fighter.
“Take <Law Killing>, punish the atrocities, save the world, close the altar, and without a single victim… … .”
I liked that sirone.
“But put it down.”
It seems that the filth that could not be hidden in front of any saint becomes equal in front of Sirone.
“It doesn’t matter, even if everyone dies today.”
That’s why Sirone is a little better than me.
“It’s not your fault, Sirone.”
But if you don’t realize it, Minerva looked down at Bessum, thinking that she would have to hand over the world to Nane at this point.
“I wish you a rebirth in paradise… … .”
was already dead
“Hahaha! Ha ha ha ha!”
Maraduk, who was holding Sirone’s lifeline with both hands, let out a hearty laugh.
The cruel devil’s temperament, which had nothing to do with his beautiful appearance, was revealed as it was.
“To see the weeping face of Yahweh.”
Hot tears flowed from Sirone’s eyes as she was about to end her breath tied to the debt of Valhalla Action.
‘I’m sorry, everyone… … .’
couldn’t save the world
‘because of me… … Because I’m weak… … .’
Just as Jacey lost her husband, countless people will shed bloody tears in pain.
“Do you have any last words to leave behind? I will leave it as a record that will never be erased in the history of the demons.”
Amy.
The first thing that came to Sirone’s mind when he heard the word will was Amy’s face.
‘I miss you.’
Because Sirone is the only person she loves more.
‘If only I had listened to you back then… … .’
If only I hadn’t turned a blind eye to the voice in my dream screaming not to go.
“Write it like this.”
said Maradouk, who had reached the limit of his patience.
“Yahweh didn’t even make a sound.”
Sirone trembled and raised his head.
“The reason I realized fraternity… … .”
The reason why I love everything that exists.
“Because I don’t want just one person to disappear.”
An unapproachable vibration came from Maradouk’s arm, which was holding Sirone’s neck.
“die! An abomination!”
Maraduk pushed with all his strength, as if to break his neck, but a greater force pushed his fingers away.
“This, this… … !”
Sirone’s body radiated light by itself, revealing a presence that was incomparable to that of Quantum Super Position.
“Yes, Sirone. If you truly want to save the world with the light of Yahweh… … .”
Minerva, who had been watching from afar, murmured.
“You must transcend ten thousand.”
The ninth sense that living things can reach, Gongjin, was waking up in Sirone’s body.

“That’s what I heard.”
The number of people Wu Lin met surpassed the criminal, so Gando did not bother to ask who they were.
“Humans have five senses.”
Uorin drew the table with her two index fingers.
“It’s like a card game, for example. Combining five cards defines a set of rules. Of course, depending on the creature, the number of cards is different, and the card you have is also different.”
“The rules that define it will also be different.”
“okay. The problem starts here. Defining the rules means starting the game.”
Uorin patted his head.
“From the moment the game starts, the pattern of combinations is endlessly accumulated. Then you realize The fact that in addition to the five cards I have, there is one more card I cannot have.”
hour.
“The experience received by the five senses is integrated into one sense, synesthesia, and stored in memory. The speed at which this synesthesia accumulates is called time.”
Time is also felt through the five senses.
“But sometimes I feel the time differently. I thought it would happen, but it really does.”
“The accumulation time of the senses has changed.”
Uorin nodded.
“We already exist in all time zones. However, because it is a being with five senses, it only feels the moment when synesthesia accumulates as reality. But some beings accumulate senses faster than humans.”
An example is an angel.
“Compared to the human present, the angelic present is much greater. By our standards, it feels like real time has exploded and expanded.”
A sixth sense accessible to creatures.
“This is called time-lapse. Sirone, who has the incarnation of a light angel, feels a greater present than the present we feel.”
“… … It’s not human.”
“So Sirone got a new card in her hand.”
the rules will change.
“A sense is something as precise as an object. Sirone, who feels time as a sense, can feel all the spaces that exist at the same time, and realized a new world.”
Gando looked out the window.
“The psychic world.”
“People who are sensitive can sometimes feel it. Things like the feeling that someone is next to you, or strange eyes that can be seen through the cracks in the door… … . Of course Park Ji is not at that level.”
“Because inaccuracies are not sensations.”
Wu Lin was satisfied.
“As we reached Shipok, Bakjiro, and Choeni Bardo, even the 7th sense was perfectly integrated. At this point, Sirone comes to sense the spirit as an object.”
Uorin spread her arms.
“What remains is scalability. Shirone, who opened the immortal function, entered the 8th sense by opening the senses of supercognition. I can sense all the information in the world.”
“I almost never came back.”
“If the spirit of Yahweh had not been supported. But he ended up becoming the Infinity Wizard.”
“Are there any more left?”
“String.”
Uorin raised her index finger.
“Sipok senses photons, and Bakji senses quantum. The granularity senses photons.”
In order, they conquered time and space, non-substance, and information.
“Information is a signal with its own personality. If so, how is that signal made?”
Her index finger bent.
“A certain form. All information in this world is made up of infinite combinations of forms created by vibrations.”
form is everything
“To put it simply, every event in this vast universe happens only once.”
Uorin, who bent her index finger, caught it on her thumb and bounced it.
“These are things that happen due to the action of a certain force.”
“Only once… … .”
“okay. To put it in the simplest terms, someone was walking down the street and saw a thread pulled tight. So I just tapped and bounced. That’s it.”
Gando kept his mouth shut.
“I don’t know how hard it bounced. The result of the universe will be split into infinity by that intensity, but in fact, it vibrated anyway, and time, space, substance and non-substance, all information are combined in a specific form by the probability that the amplitude creates, and this world we live in now It is what the world was made of.”
Uorin looked up at the ceiling.
“We are living by leaning on that power in the vibrational amplitude of a single thread. It will stop someday, but that is a day so far away that even I, who have lived for an eternity, can’t imagine. Let alone stop, we don’t even know when the amplitude will decrease. Of course, by then this universe will have to come to an end.”
It was a scale that even Jiandao could not have imagined.
“Only vibration is the whole. All information is vibrating in the process of endlessly repeating poles and poles.”
“Then, resonance… … .”
“okay.”
Uorin looked back at Gando.
“The world that can be explored by those who have realized supercognition is no longer fixed. It is an endlessly fluctuating world, caused by just one force. And the 8 senses combined with the strings… … .”
Opening her fan, she uttered solemnly.
“It means that it can resonate with the vibrations of the world.”
“… … .”
Although he didn’t understand everything, Gando bowed his head in an unknown sense of awe.
* * *
“Great!”
Maraduk, who was holding Sirone’s neck with both hands, frowned at the harsh vibration.
“What the hell are you?”
What was truly frightening was not the vibration, but the numerous vibrations felt through the transmission.
It was as if the whole world was shaking with Sirone’s vibrations, and Maraduk’s vision was shaking terribly up and down.
“Abominable Yahweh!”
As he twisted Sirone’s neck hard, the afterimages of Sirone created by the vibration began to suffer with different expressions.
“Aww!”
What Maraduk realized through that expression was that the number of afterimages exceeded 10,000 units.
“What is this?”
I wanted to break my neck right now, but Yahweh’s light was canceling out the devil’s energy.
“die! die! die!”
As the thick arm muscles swelled to the point of explosion, Sirone’s vibrations intensified.
There seemed to be well over 100,000 sirones, and screams leaked out from the overlapping of all kinds of expressions.
It was a sound that could not be heard even in hell.
“Huh.”
In front of that cosmic phenomenon, for the first time in his life, Maradouk felt a fear of the unknown.
Sirone shedding tears of blood, sirone screaming, sirone crying out for help.
“… … Are you mocking me?”
Through the afterimages, I could see Sirone sticking out his tongue while laughing, Sirone ecstatic, and Sirone bursting into laughter.
“How dare you mock the corps commander!”
At that time, Maraduk, who has raised the energy of destruction, gives strength to his hands with the determination to consume his life.
‘The afterimage is disappearing.’
It was exactly the same reaction that resonated.
Tens of thousands of sirones turned into thousands, then hundreds, and finally dozens.
“Mmmmm!”
Sirone, who gritted her teeth and endured pain, with the same expression, was just swaying back and forth quickly.
‘No, it’s not shaking.’
If one person had been shaken at this speed, the brain would have already been killed inside the skull.
‘A huge number of incidents.’
It was a process in which 100,000 sirones overlapping with quantum superpositions were combined into one piece of information.
“Huh.”
The moment when the gradually diminishing afterimages go from 5 to 3 and finally to one Sirone.
“Are you still doing that?”
Valhalla Action’s debt is gone.
“We will die together! Yahweh!”
At the moment when Maraduk exploded his magical powers and chose to return, Sirone’s eyes widened.
‘Resonance!’
The Sirone, united into one Sirone, spread the light of Yahweh in the Spirit Zone with a diameter of 40 kilometers.
“Kuaaaaa!”
The demons, with only infected people left, turned to ashes and scattered, screaming desperately.
“It’s warm… … .”
The corner of Minerva’s mouth went up slightly as she bit into the smoking pipe with her eyes closed.
“Hey Yahweh! Yahweh!”
As Maraduk’s screams pierced my eardrums, the feeling of choking was completely gone.
When Sirone slowly opened her eyes, Maraduk, whose limbs had melted, was on her knees clenching her teeth.
“How evil are you?”
Being able to withstand the light of Yahweh meant that the demon of the corps commander was equivalent to Satan.
“Don’t think it’s over.”
Maraduk raised his head.
“There are many ways to annoy you. Repent, Yahweh. Realize your foolishness and follow the devil’s path!”
Maraduk’s body turned black and began to reveal the true form of a demon.
Even her beautiful appearance was nothing more than a body made up of small efforts, and she became a hideous shadow that attacked Sirone.
“I will destroy you.”
The squeaking sound of bugs replaced the vocal chords.
“Ataraxia.”
At the same time as the sphere of ataraxia wrapped around Sirone’s body, light exploded.
Slayer Dragon Magic Quasar.
Numerous lights flew in a parabolic arc from all sides, trapping Maraduk in a huge sphere of light.
“Quaaaaaa!”
It was as if ink had been dropped into water, but a much more repulsive silhouette was wriggling around.
“I will not forgive you! Hey Satan… … please Yahweh… … .”
As the small forces dissipated, the sound disappeared, and when the quasar’s light disappeared, not a speck of dust remained.
“It is over.”
Looking back, Minerva was approaching.
“no. This is just the beginning.”
Just as Sirone looked back at the sunset over the horizon, Minerva hit her head.
“ouch! Why are you hitting me?”
“Isn’t that cool at all? Did you think I would look at you with moved eyes when I turned around like that?”
“no?”
Minerva pointed.
“Anyway, you’ve figured it out now. Abandon the obsession of protecting everyone. I like moving with efficiency in mind.”
Sirone rubbed her sore head and said.
“It’s still what I have to do.”
“Even if this happens… … !”
“But, if you can’t protect it, there’s nothing you can do about it.”
The ferocity in Minerva’s eyes disappeared.
‘Began to put myself in the whole.’
What you can’t do is what you can’t do.
‘It’s only true to admit that.’
And the highest efficiency for perfection.
“I am not afraid anymore. I just do my best and do what I can.”
If the delusion was destroyed, Minerva’s will to follow Sirone’s perfection was also valid.
“good. Shall we seal the altar then? Let’s report to Taeseong and fly to Kashan right away.”
The agenda of the stars was endless, and Minerva soared into the sky in a jet.
Since he should be able to catch up with her now, Sirone stayed for a while to gather his thoughts.
‘A new sensation. This must be the ninth.’
I don’t know that the 9th sense is called resonance, but I have heard about the 10th.
‘Inert.’
And now I have a vague idea of what kind of world that sense is hidden in.
‘Manipulation of all world information. And if this is possible, theoretically… … .’
Reset, you can reset the world.
‘Sensation of Ankera.’
If there was an owner in this world, it was definitely the manager’s authority, and it was doubtful whether even Sirone would reach it.
The reason Sirone, a human, was able to acquire a 6th sense is because she inherited the senses of an archangel.
‘Ikael.’
Also, the reason why I was able to rise to the 9th sense is because the end of the senses, the 11th sense Ultima led me.
‘Guffin.’
Ikael pushed it and Guffin pulled it up.
‘After being made human… … .’
In a situation where one last sense was left, Sirone remembered them and felt a terrible longing.

[766] Apostasy (1)
“Down with Yahweh!”
I realized that the 8 million demons in the capital, Pacia, are just the tip of the iceberg.
hell indeed.
Where the flames were burning, an endless procession of demons continued.
“What about the walking dead?”
Minerva knew what Sirone was thinking.
“Can you destroy all the demons?”
The psychic realm is just a passage between reality and the other side, so if you cause an infection here, it will spread throughout hell.
“When did you stop using forbidden magic?”
“It was because I didn’t know what it was. If the opponent is a demon… … .”
“If I could, I would have done it right away.”
When there was no answer, Minerva spoke frankly.
“Actually, I already did.”
“How was it?”
Minerva shook her head.
“Brigade commanders are not fools either. In 2 minutes and 32 seconds of the spread of the infection, the entire area was quarantined (quarantined).”
“Are you capable?”
“huh. It must be Paimon, the commander of the 9th Corps. You hold a military post in the army of hell. Unless it’s an all-out war, it’s not a demon you can meet right away… … .”
Minerva turned to a land where animal bones piled high like a mountain.
“The millions of troops infected in Pasia are not even close to activating Quarantine by Paimon’s standards. Rather, the capital itself has become a good quarantine zone.”
Hell’s army is 2 billion and is endlessly produced.
“If you are now, you can deal with two corps commanders, but you better be careful with those who are in the top 10. Because they have different concentrations of demons.”
Sirone was engraved.
“We are almost there.”
Dozens of structures soared high like awls beneath blazing clouds of flame.
It was the castle of Maradouk who lost its owner.
“Isn’t this the first time sealing the corps commander’s area?”
The only way to seal the altar is to destroy all demons in the area.
“yes.”
Since the other side world itself is made of demons, the key was to block the tributary of demons called ‘Bulpan’.
“We are still exploring where the headwaters are.”
Currently, armies from around the world and the Valkyrie of the Crusade were risking their lives to explore the underworld.
“Anyway, the hell fire that starts at the source of the fire plate spreads like blood vessels throughout the world, supplying the devil.”
After passing the mountain range made of animal bones, Maraduk’s castle came into view clearly.
“oh my god… … .”
Even Sirone, who had sealed several altars, could not keep his mouth shut.
A river of lava more than ten kilometers wide meandered, burning blindingly red.
“This is the upper reaches of hellfire.”
Just as civilization in the real world is based on water, rivers of fire flowed in the underworld.
“help me! Please someone save me!”
Well, thousands of humans struggled with their arms in the form of molten lava.
“They are dead.”
“To be precise, the spirits of the dead were condensed into demons. Because the fear of death is too strong for an ordinary human being.”
“The human heart is hell.”
Zulu’s insight was correct.
In the end, the dead who could not overcome the pain of hell fire would be reborn as demons according to Satan’s will.
‘Mr. Gaold.’
He didn’t give in to the pain.
‘So even now… … .’
Sirone, unaware that Gaold had come to his senses, prayed for him to return as soon as possible.
“Let’s go down.”
As the jet descended rapidly to the ground, Sirone also followed suit, breaking the light wing.
The sound of burning lava made me deaf, and at the end of my field of vision, the inhabitants of the other world formed a circle.
Minerva didn’t care and pointed at the lava.
“how is it? Can you destroy it?”
The river of hell fire that I came down and looked at was so huge that I couldn’t tell it from the sea.
“I can’t promise. Hellfire is much more persistent than demons. I had a hard time even getting rid of one stream.”
Minerva nodded.
“Because it is the essence of demons. At this scale, it should be considered that the emotions of about 500 million people in the real world are flowing. The problem is that as long as the hellfire flows, the demons also stand up to Yahweh’s light.”
This was the reason why the corps commander’s realm was much more difficult to seal than the psychic realm of other altars.
“There is only one way.”
Minerva pointed to Maradouk’s castle.
“There is a ‘bulpan’ in the corps commander’s castle. Adjust the concentration of hellfire to create powerful demons. We take control of the device that controls the flow of hellfire.”
When the conclusion was reached, the action was quick, and the two immediately flew to Maradouk’s castle.
The villagers who lost their corps commander couldn’t approach Sirone, but the hell’s troops stationed in the castle burned with fighting spirit.
“Yahweh! It must be stopped!”
It was none other than those who came to cut their lifelines.
Numerous troops, including the division commander, gathered at the entrance.
“open it.”
Yahweh’s light would not be a cure for the strongest demons, but Sirone took the lead.
‘Angel’s Punishment.’
The incarnation of the light angel rose in a huge way and looked down at the ground while holding onto the spear of light.
“This is my whole.”
Only 滿..
As quantum information was integrated into one through resonance, 100,000 sirones were not needed.
“Repent.”
And finally, the moment when the spear of light stretched out in a flash and plunged into the ground.
“… … !”
Light burst first, followed by a shock wave that reduced the hellish army to ashes.
“Uh uh uh?”
The demons who were watching from afar were stunned by the huge cloud of dust pushed in by the wind.
“Kuaaaaa!”
As the roar overtook the wind and shook the heavens and earth, all the frightened demons turned around.
“Eh, run away!”
Just when they thought they would never be able to set foot here again, a cloud of dust hit them.
Covering her face with her hands, Minerva frowned as the wind pierced her flesh.
“Pooh woo woo!”
After a while, the wind direction reversed.
The place where the shock wave exploded turned into a vacuum, drawing in the surrounding atmosphere.
“Let’s see… … .”
As Minerva checked the front, what was reflected in her eyes was a crater that would have appeared when a meteorite collided.
“The area of undoubted apostasy.”
In the human body, it eventually reached.
‘What will happen now.’
Aside from the shivering joy, Minerva’s face showed serious emotion.
* * *
“Huh uh uh uh!”
Acet Mayray, a person who corresponds to the hearing of the Great Purifier, flipped his eyes in the separate room of the Tormia Magic Association.
“Is there a problem?”
Under Rufist’s instructions, the wizard who guarded her room like a cage opened the door roughly and came in.
“yes?”
Mayray blinked and turned around.
“No, what did you just say… … .”
“Sound? Did nothing happen?”
The wizard looked around the room, and it was definitely a tidy scene, far from the hustle and bustle.
‘Is it a physiological phenomenon?’
If you’re a woman, you might be ashamed.
“All right. Call me if you need anything.”
“yes. Thank you for caring me.”
The wizard couldn’t figure out that human emotions were missing from Maylei’s calm gaze.
“then… … .”
When the door closed, the face that had at least some humanity turned into that of a perfect doll.
“Chief Justice.”
When Mayray replied with one ear covered, the Supreme Court of Terraforce delivered a revelation.
-A little while ago, a power that transcended the living world was sensed.
“okay. Who is it?”
– Representative of humanity, Hexa.
“… … .”
I realized why the Supreme Court was worried.
“What about the congressional ruling?”
The reason Terraforce is called an evil god in the human scriptures is because they actually destroyed countless civilizations.
But they are not invaders.
Rather, he was a guardian of the order of the universe, and that is why Taeseong once made this hypothesis.
user protection system.
This can also be inferred through the 3 absolute principles recorded in the Great Law of the Terraforce race.
One, we promote the development of mankind and, if necessary, directly intervene in human history.
One, in the confrontation between good and evil, when evil completely wins, we destroy that civilization.
One, we actively block certain creatures with will when they invade the upper system.
The reason for Terra Force’s existence is to maintain the balance of the universe, not as a species.
In addition, the standard of balance was focused on existence itself beyond human happiness and unhappiness.
‘Lest the balance be disturbed by any single variable, and no foul play be committed in the lives of fierce creatures.’
judge of the law.
Mayray, who came to understand Terraforce through numerous oracles, calmly waited for the next words.
-The breaking of Hexa violates the last question of the 3 absolute principles, but there are judges who focus on the second question.
There is no priority in the absolute triad, so the terms are not numbered and all have position 1.
-In the end, if evil wins, we abolish it. Now that the confrontation between good and evil has reached its end, it is an interpretation that there is room for a reprieve if it is Hexa, the representative of mankind.
“That makes sense. If evil wins, everything will end, but Hexa’s apostasy is only about actively blocking it.”
-You are better than the Congress.
Of course, it was a joke, and I could guess the opinion of the Supreme Court of Terraforce through his words.
‘But that’s not to say that the backlash is formidable.’
Terraforce can collect all sounds in the universe, and Mayray’s mind was no exception.
-okay. Judgment Day may come sooner. Of course, the final decision is mine.
“What am I going to do?”
-Go to Zion. You will need your ears to face the opposition of evil. If there is any room for the line to be reversed, the council may have a different opinion.
“All right.”
Realizing that the communication hasn’t been cut off yet, Maylei hurriedly asked.
“I have a question. If Terra Force guided mankind, then who created the 3 absolute principles that guide Terra Force?”
Natural curiosity that comes from being human.
– As you guessed.
Communication was lost.
“Ankera… … .”
And now it was me.
Mayray, who was staring fiercely forward, jumped up from her seat and opened the door.
“Please let me meet the president of the association!”

Sirone and Minerva, who occupied Maraduk’s castle, found a ‘fire plate’ on the 8th basement floor.
Inside the blast furnace, hundreds of meters in diameter, lava was burning and the dead were struggling.
“It is terrible.”
If Yahweh’s light had not blocked the heat, the body would have burned while standing.
“A demon that is as strong as it is terrifying will be born. They probably draw hellfire from there.”
Lava flowed endlessly from dozens of drains installed on the walls.
“If you block the stream of fire from upstream, the demons in Maraduk’s territory won’t be able to use their strength. It will probably be organized into the domain of another corps commander.”
“What if I come back and open the furnace?”
“You shouldn’t be able to do that. North Eymond is already in anarchy, so let’s give instructions to the South Eymond’s governor. You can send a separate garrison from the temple.”
“Nothing is easy.”
“It is all about living. Do you know why the stars are busy? No matter how many times you circle the planet, there is no end.”
Sirone approached the control device of the ‘fire plate’.
“It’s very old-fashioned.”
“You know what? Demons live by recycling things that humans have discarded.”
“… … .”
As I was about to pull the switch that was engaged with hundreds of gears, I heard a sound from the fire.
“Sah, live… … .”
One demon climbed to the floor while breaking through the flames of the furnace.
“Please save me. It is too painful.”
While the terrifying demon crawled across the floor, Sirone did not let go of the switch.
“Ah, Yahweh… … .”
The demon suddenly surged up, revealing its teeth.
“What are you so good at!”
The Demons hit by the Photon Cannon flew in a straight line and fell into the middle of the furnace.
“Don’t pretend to be clean! You are just like us! hate! Arrogant Yahweh… … !”
The demons melted into raw material.
“… … .”
While watching the scene with sad eyes, Sirone’s hand slowly turned the switch.
Kurung. Kurung. Kurung.
The sound of the gearwheel turning was deafening.

Southern Eymond Republic.
Almaretta’s expression at the cabinet meeting was surprisingly reminded.
‘Is unification finally coming?’
According to the spy’s information, Igor was already dead and the capital city of Pacia was liberated a few hours ago.
‘How did that happen… … ?’
It was a situation where there was no choice but to question, but the cool-headedness disappeared in the face of hope that the long war could be ended.
Ministers waiting for the presidency also heard the news of liberation through their own channels, but few knew the exact issue.
“Is this really reliable information? There are many strange corners. There will be no harm on our side.”
The country that avoided the invasion of the demons was one of the few countries in the world, but the war was also booming for the ministers.
‘Because I make a lot of money.’
The people who were close to death saw no reason to oppose Congress’s tax increase.
“Out of 400 North Korean spies, only one sent the news of liberation. Aren’t you too excited?”
The fact that only Jaycee survived meant that no one could escape the demons’ surveillance.
“He is a trustworthy person. He is talented and has a deep sense of patriotism. It is true that Igor is dead.”
The Home Secretary asked, turning to the Defense Minister.
“What happened?”
Just in time, Almaretta came in.
“I will explain.”
As the ministers rose, she motioned for her to sit down and went up the honor guard.
“It is true that North Eymond has been liberated.”
“Do you have any grounds to conclude?”
“Because Igor died a long time ago.”
The conference room was buzzing.
“To begin with, the core force that led this incident is neither the resistance nor the anarchists, but the Ivory Tower.”
A sigh escaped the ministers.
“I will brief you.”
As the defense minister got up and walked to the honor guard, Almaretta stepped aside.
A 30-minute briefing followed.
“… … It is estimated that the number of demons currently residing in the capital is less than 10 units, and the two stars seem to have left to seal the altar.”
A shadow fell over the faces of the ministers.
“In just one day… … You said you liberated Pasia alone?”
“Monstrous bastards.”
What kind of people are the stars of the ivory tower?
“Thank you for the briefing.”
As the Minister of Defense returned to his seat, President Almaretta touched the podium with his hand and said.
“As you may have guessed, we are at the most important crossroads since the division. North Korea is currently in a state of anarchy. It’s a point where every minute and every second is a waste.”
said the Home Secretary.
“We should immediately send troops to occupy the North. It has been our land since the beginning. We cannot hand it over to another country.”
Almaretta nodded.
“I agree. However, if we act assertively, we will rise from the ivory tower. We have to go through a mutual agreement.”
I used the expression mutual agreement in good words, but the ministers who had experience dealing with the stars grunted.
‘I’ll have to pray for my hands to become feet.’
said the foreign minister.
“Leave it to me. Even if it is given, I am confident that the right to interfere with the North will come.”
The word “dealing with the stars” is absurd, but the foreign minister once struck a dramatic deal against the ivory tower.
“no. This time, I will negotiate myself.”
“Are you the Commander?”
The stars couldn’t help it if they wanted to, but usually the head of a country did not dare to be humiliated.
“What kind of stars are these? Do we even know each other?”
“that… … It is a special secret.”
Even if you are a star in the ivory tower, you are a citizen and a magician who once belonged to a certain country.
In any case, it was not good for the country to reveal their identities in advance at a ministerial-level gathering.
The foreign minister spoke like an experienced person.
“However, we need to know how much, so we can prepare to welcome guests, right? How many stars do you have?”
According to his theory, the stars of the ivory tower had slightly different tendencies according to the number of stars.
“The number of stars is 10.”
“Ten… … .”
The Foreign Minister, who had been rolling his eyes while searching for memories, frowned and tilted his head.
“wait a minute. It’s two people, but how can 10 stars… … .”
The foreign minister’s face hardened as if it had been stuffed.
“10 things?”
The basic arithmetic of 5 plus 5 equals 10 passed through their heads, and all the ministers gulped their saliva.
“Now you know roughly, right?”
As the ministers slowly turned their heads, Almaretta gave a chin gesture to the door.
“What are you doing, aren’t you moving fast?”
Sirone and Minerva boarded the jet and quickly crossed the airspace over South Eymond.
“That’s Gardan, the capital.”
It was a huge city built in the middle of a meadow.
“It’s bigger than Basuka.”
“Because it is a republic. Even with the social costs, the development speed is much faster than that of the kingdom. The national defense is extremely high.”
Tormia is also a powerful country, but it is said that South Eamond’s defense power is comparable to that of the Seven Kingdoms.
“Still, I like Tormia better.”
“Whoops, who said what?”
The state has no meaning to the star of the ivory tower, but Sirone, who has regained her humanity, is not bad.
“Let’s get off in front of the castle gate.”
“are you okay. The star of the ivory tower is also a free pass to the airspace. And you think you already know everything?”
A procession of troops continued up to the government building.
“Is this your first time meeting the chief? Maybe the soldiers are out of their minds right now. I’ll peck you like crazy from the top.”
“Do I really need to be so welcoming?”
“No. I’m doing that because I have something to tear off. Don’t be swayed, just do what I tell you to do.”
When we reached the government building over the city wall faster than the sound, the officer shouted in a engrossed posture.
“Embrace extreme poverty!”
Citizens who had been airlifted in advance sprinkled pollen to match the performance of the military band, and a grand welcome ceremony was held.
“Never mind. Just look ahead and walk.”
Sirone, who knew that it was not just a favor, moved on with a cautious expression.
Ministers, vice ministers, experts and heads of departments, and commanders wearing the rank of general.
‘That person… … .’
Almaretta, the president of South Eymond, who was standing against the background of the government building, approached with a humble smile.
“Come, come, poor man. Thank you for visiting South Eymond Republic.”
Even as the people watched, she bowed her head twice to Sirone and Minerva.
‘I risked life and death.’
While Minerva gave a meaningful smile, Sirone didn’t know how to respond.
“Uh, I belong to the Ivory Tower… … .”
Ignoring the president, Minerva turned to a man in his early 50s standing to her side and said,
“Long time no see, kid?”
Nam Eymond Magic Association president, Luda Garcia, replied with a slight nod.
“long time no see.”
A certified first-class wizard who has honed fire magic to the limit, his fireball is said to burn down a village.
“again.”
Minerva bent her index finger down as if lowering her head further.
“… … .”
Garcia was motionless.
“again.”
“This is a welcome ceremony prepared with the utmost effort. Let’s not do anything that lowers the dignity of each other.”
Sirone felt it from the first time he saw Garcia.
‘Strong, this person.’
It was a prayer that did not fall in the slightest compared to Lufist, the head of Tormia’s Magic Association.
“again. This is your last chance.”
Almaretta, completely forgotten about being ignored, winked with a puzzled expression.
‘I just do it. You know this human nature.’
Garcia bowed at a 90 degree angle.
“It’s been a while, Star of the Ivory Tower.”
Minerva, who was looking down at him with cold eyes, pointed at Sirone with her chin.
“There is one more.”
Garcia showed no emotion.
“nice to see you. This is Garcia, the head of the Magic Association.”
“yes. This is Ariane Sirone.”
Long words would only hurt his feelings.
“Hey, are you the president of the association? it’s grown a lot It seems like yesterday that you were trembling in front of me.”
Minerva’s age was felt again.
“I wasn’t trembling.”
“Sirone, remember this guy’s name. Because it’s the best in the world in terms of fire.”
The fact that Minerva, who did not pay attention to the president, introduced herself, was credible.
Almaretta’s face turned cold as if it were a lie after leading the two into the conference room.
“Can I be direct?”
“What’s the point of asking someone else? do it anyway I’ve seen enough of the president’s sincerity.”
It was the head bowed to have this right to speak.
“Give me the right to rule the North. I will not take care of the altar, nor will I do anything that will be criticized by other countries.”
All the republic wants is money.
“What do you want to do, Sirone?”
It’s easier to leave it to Nam Eymond, but I thought it would be better for the temple to manage the altar.
“It is not completely sealed. Are you sure you will never break through?”
“The president never uses the word absolute. However, I am proud of Nam Eymond’s national defense.”
Almaretta took a quick glance and pulled out a box from under the table and held it out.
“And this one is weak.”
Sirone’s impression was crumpled at once.
“In this way… … .”
But before he could say anything, Minerva took the box and opened it.
Contrary to what was expected to be gold and silver treasures, it was a bond, and the amount was written where the state seal was stamped.
“You know I’m not kidding.”
“It’s 10% of South Eymond’s national budget. Please leave it to me. I am confident to satisfy the ivory tower.”
Sirone’s eyes widened.
‘Giving 10% of the national budget? It’s not at the lobby level. You should never accept this.’
Minerva, who was rubbing the bond, threw it with a flick.
“It’s troublesome if it’s like this.”
‘also. Minerva is also a star in the ivory tower.’
Just when I felt ashamed of doubting her for a moment, I heard shocking words.
“Half of the national budget. No less.”
At first, I doubted my ears.
The amount of 10% they suggested was the same, but one human being didn’t need that much money to live his whole life.
‘… … I see.’
Almaretta looked at Sirone with tears in her eyes.
“That is too much to ask for. How will you run state affairs if half of the budget is taken away?”
“what do you think about it?”
Sirone nodded and said.
“If it’s half the time, I’ll allow it too.”
“… … .”
Again, like a lie, the emotion was quickly erased from Almaretta’s earnest eyes.
“Twenty-five. I cannot yield more than that.”
“We said 50%.”
“Thirty percent. Anything more and they would rather give up their sovereignty over North Eymond.”
“40%. Let’s finish with this. I don’t offer two methods. Either pay 10% annually over four years, or hand over the government bonds now.”
“… … I will give it to you now.”
Minerva shrugged and laughed.
“You’re a pretty good president, you.”
It was expected that other countries would pay more than that during the four years of paying 10% each.
However, if I end the contract now, there will be no future interference in the ivory tower forever.
‘In other words… … .’
It means that even if you give 40% of the annual budget, having the governance of North Eymond is a business with much more money.
‘Still, this won’t cause Nam Eymond to run wild. It would be better to end it at this level.’
What was surprising was that Sirone realized his intentions at a fairly early point in time.
‘I thought he was smart, but surprisingly he’s a solid guy.’
If it was 40% of a country’s budget, it would be an amount that Minerva could not exhaust even if she spent her whole life.
Sirone realized that it was not a matter of money, but that Eymond Nam needed to cut the budget.
‘It’s already a military force comparable to the Seven Kingdoms. If North Eymond is absorbed, it will become another seed of trouble.’
Almaretta held out its newly drawn bonds.
“Both of you are in the best position in the ivory tower, so I believe there will be no backtracking with this.”
The amount amounting to 40% of the national budget was written.

“This neatly solved the problem!”
As Minerva tried to put the bond in her bosom, Sirone quickly grabbed her wrist.
“Wait a minute.”
“okay okay. I was going to split it in half anyway.”
“Why do you need all this money?”
It was an amount that transcended the limits of luxury that an individual could afford.
“I don’t know since you’ve just taken over the department, but do you know how much money is broken running the ivory tower? With the income of the Kingdom of Corona, there is no way.”
“So you openly ask for money?”
“Isn’t that what we asked for? it’s a fair deal Besides, Nam Eymond never lost money.”
Cutting 40% of the budget is fatal to the country’s operation, but from a long-term perspective, it was like eating the country for free.
“You were the one who liberated North Eymond. Calculating the consequences of your actions is also the task of the stars.”
If North Eymond was handed over without any checks, the balance between the countries would collapse.
‘Even if I entrust it to the temple, there is no difference.’
After shaking off Sirone’s wrist, she took out the bond again and shook it in front of her eyes.
“If I’m not going to have it, will I eat it all?”
“follow your heart.”
From the standpoint of the Unified Space Management Department, it was only hoped that it would be used well for the safety of mankind.
“Let’s go back. I have to report it to Taeseong.”
As I was walking towards the exit of the government building, someone blocked my way.
“what?”
He was a ferocious young man with the left side of his head shaved like a chestnut and scratches on his temple.
The hair on the other side was twisted down in dozens of strands, and at the ends were accessories that looked like beast teeth.
‘It’s a wizard.’
I felt the spirit zone of an outright aggressive type that doesn’t think about the feelings of the opponent at all.
“hello. My name is Sky Hugo, the authorized wizard of Nam Eymond.”
Minerva immediately responded.
“I don’t know. What are you saying?”
Hugo’s face was burning because he was a magician everyone knew in South Eymond.
‘Sheesh, you really don’t know?’
Just in case, I looked back at Sirone, but I only blinked with an innocent expression.
“It’s disappointing. Minerva is a senior, so even so, Sirone, I thought you were a little different.”
Minerva made an absurd expression.
“Miss Minerva? you?”
Even Garcia, the head of the South Eymond Magic Association, could not call themselves this way.
As if Yuugo knew that he had crossed the line, he immediately lowered his head and introduced himself.
“I’m sorry if I felt rude. Because they are not like others to me.”
“Why are we not like others?”
“Yeah… … I was also an ivory tower candidate.”
Sirone raised her eyebrows.
“You said you were a candidate?”
Starting with La Enemy, the candidates Arte introduced earlier were all Nane, Jin Seong-eum, and Sirone.
“The number of candidates selected by the Ivory Tower this time is 10 in total. And I was ninth in the rankings.”
If true, the unpleasantness was understandable.
“Oh, sorry. As for the candidates… … .”
Minerva interrupted Sirone.
“Sky Hugo, number 9 in rank. Like you, I’m an Unlocker who opened Immortal Functions, and I’m a Scale Wizard.”
Whenever he pretended not to know, when the information came out, Hugo’s lips went up.
“It is an honor to remember you.”
Sirone was also surprised.
“Did you know?”
“Nothing… … . If it’s the Sky family, it’s more eye-catching than other candidates. It’s because they’re the world’s best seeker family, comparable to the Maze’s Adrias family.”
When I heard the name Miro, I got a sense of how much it was.
“Until the labyrinth appeared, it was so tight that it was impossible to compare superiority and inferiority. If Adrias is defensive, Sky is aggressive. It can be seen as the difference between convergence and divergence.”
Yoga of the Ardino family branched off from Adrias also boasted the world’s best defense.
“Since the seeker family has been studying the logic of the world since birth, the probability of entering the Immortal Function is quite high. Maybe Sky is pushing it at the national level.”
“Hmm.”
While Sirone was lost in thought, Minerva asked again.
“But why us?”
The reason Miro is great is because he was uniquely great even in the great Adrias family.
There was no reason for Daesung Oh to change his attitude just because he put up the nameplate of the Sky family.
Hugo’s face was slightly distorted, but it turned into a wide smile like a reaction.
“haha! Yes. Well, I’m just a wizard who didn’t get into the ivory tower. But you know what? That we never had a chance to be tested.”
Hugo pointed at Sirone.
“I heard that Mr. Sirone was no different from me, right? Unless there was an absolute candidate called La Enemy.”
At that time, Sirone’s candidate rank was 4th.
Although they were tied to a group similar to Nane and Seong-eum’s Kar-Suchi, it was undeniable that they were lucky.
‘I can see why you’re angry.’
Sirone, who rose to the top of the Five Stars, was proving the fact that Karuchi was not absolute.
‘Beyond Nane and Seong-eum and became a star.’
It is said that it is Yahweh’s state now, but even at the time of the test, Sirone’s skills were far from what they are now.
‘If only I had been given a chance… … .’
Hugo thought that if 10 candidates had been tested equally, the current results would not have come out.
“Aha, okay.”
There was mischief in Minerva’s eyes.
“In some cases, opportunity is everything. So what are you going to do? Death fight? Whoever wins becomes Oh Dae-seong?”
Cruelly stepping on sprouts that grow without knowing how high they are is her favorite hobby.
“It’s not that stupid. I don’t have any regrets about being in the position of Odaeseong.”
Hugo was displeased with Minerva, who was treated like a child.
‘The gap has already widened.’
He was the one who missed the biggest opportunity for growth because he couldn’t overtake five more of the best students in the world.
‘father.’
When Sirone reached the realm of Yahweh, Hugo’s father, Cassia, who now joined the Zion Project, said:
-Assume there is no sirone.
The moment you think there is, all the wizards in this world will lose their aspirations for the best.
‘Are you going to be pushed back again?’
Just as the labyrinth frustrated all wizards a generation ago.
“I have no intention of being stubborn. Mr. Sirone’s skills were proven just by being one of the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower.”
Minerva was disappointed.
“Then what are you going to do?”
“How about something like this? It is to compete with incarnation, not magic.”
depth of the realm.
“Hoo? Really, is that interesting?”
When Hugo came out unexpectedly hard, the light of hope shone in Minerva’s eyes again.
‘It’s quite belligerent. It’s also Sky.’
Like a beast waiting for its leash to be undone, it was clear that he was anxiously waiting for Sirone to allow it.
“Sirone, let’s do it. Isn’t it impersonal to pretend to be ignorant when you’re polite like that?”
do it, do it
Hugo also added his words to Minerva’s support, who was eager to have a good look.
“Let me be clear, this is not a challenge. However, if Mr. Sirone’s vessel is large, she might be able to understand the stubbornness created by my narrow vessel.”
In the end, it meant that I couldn’t admit it.
‘At least not far behind in the depth of the realm. Because I am the strongest swordsman weapon produced by my family.’
Of course, that’s not what Cassia taught.
However, the 3rd generation Hugo sensitively felt the atmosphere of the family that had to stay in the shadow of the maze for decades.
“I understand how you feel, but… … .”
After thinking, Sirone said.
“sorry. I don’t want to fight you.”
Minerva was more disappointed.
“Why why? Don’t you think about how unfair Yuugo must be? It’s not like you can see the stars often, so you just have to do it.”
Minerva’s inner thoughts were clearly visible.
“Don’t interrupt and be quiet. Since when did you care so much about other people’s affairs?”
Hugo tightened his eyes and spat out.
“… … Can I think of it as running away?”
“Yes, that is an accurate expression. I don’t want to win, and I don’t care if I lose to you.”
Hugo’s teeth were grinding.
“Of course you would.”
Since I had already thoroughly enjoyed the view from the highest point, it was enough to give it to someone else and come down.
‘That is unacceptable.’
The best position is that you cannot be satisfied unless you pull it out.
There was no substitute for concessions.
“I would also like to ask.”
When Sirone turned around, Garcia lowered her head, which was so immobile.
“sorry. I don’t think there is any need for anyone to feel defeated here.”
Garcia has arrived.
“Hugo is a global talent. Although he did not become a star, the Republic takes great pride in him.”
“The president of the association.”
It was the words of a senior who was far from the official rank, so this time, Wigo also relaxed his expression.
“The enemy we must fight now is not us, but the demons in our hearts. I fully understand the deep meaning of the five stars.”
Garcia looked back at Hugo.
“Wugo is no different from worrying about the world. It’s just that we’re human, so we’re just blocked by a wall we haven’t been able to fight against. I think that helping Oh Dae-seong overcome that wall is the way for him to become the core force of mankind.”
Minerva closed her eyes and nodded.
“That’s a good point. Something like Yugo, no, Yugo would be enough in the future… … .”
Sirone stopped talking.
“I can’t guarantee that it will help.”
“It will help.”
Whether he knew the subject by losing to Sirone or perhaps he really beat Sirone, at least the lump would disappear.
‘If it’s a confrontation of incarnation, the latter possibility… … .’
Garcia knew better than anyone what kind of temperament the incarnation of Hugo had.
“great.”
As soon as the word of consent came out, the eyes of the three people who were focused on Sirone shone intensely.
“but… … .”
From now on, Sirone was also sincere.
“If you’re going to have a confrontation for that reason, I won’t moderate it.”
“This is what Hugo and I hoped for.”
Minerva said to herself.
‘Of course me too.’
As if hearing the sound of her heart, Sirone sighed and moved on.
“Where can I do it?”
“There are a lot of eyes in the government office. It would be a secret enough if it was Sky’s parent house.”
I said this because I thought of Oh Dae-sung’s body, but on the other hand, it was like having a confrontation in the enemy camp.
Sirone didn’t care.
“great. Then let’s go there. I’m running out of time, so I’d better start right away.”
When Sirone left the government building first, Hugo met Garcia’s eyes and clenched his fists.
‘done!’
The Ivory Tower, where the world’s best wizards gather, and Odaeseong, which stands at the top… … .
‘The chance to win is here!’
Minerva tapped Garcia’s butt as he left the government building following Hugo.
“Good job, very good job. What are you doing? I do things that help my life.”
Garcia didn’t answer.
“Shall we bet? Grant the wish of the winner. Let’s buy something on the way. You have to watch this while eating.”
‘I really hate this girl… … .’
Garcia didn’t answer.

Hugo’s home was a huge temple built on a meadow 14 kilometers from the capital, Gardan.
It was the place where the largest number of ascetics in the world stayed, except for Dongbang Jungcheon-dong, which is a sacred place for monks.
However, since most of them are currently participating in the Shion Project, the temple was empty when Sirone arrived.
“Wugo?”
Hugo’s cousins, who received the news that the head of the Magic Association had arrived, rushed in.
“What’s going on at the main house? And who are these people?”
When Justice Terraforce judged the entire human race, the number of good was less than 1% of the total population.
Their failure to enter Zion was proof that their discipline had not yet reached its peak.
Hugo introduced it himself.
“You are the stars of the ivory tower. This is St. Arian Syrone, and this is St. Mirac Minerva.”
“Arian Sirone?”
For the relatives of the Sky family who supported Hugo, Sirone was a very painful name.
“A very great person has arrived. Oh Dae-seong, who is at the top of the world, is in such a shabby place… … .”
Garcia explained before the atmosphere heated up.
“Hugo asked for instruction. Could you lend me a place to perform the incarnation?”
The faces of my cousins came to mind.
‘You finally got your chance. Good job, Hugo.’
Miro does not consider Sirone to be a disciple, but it is an undeniable fact that he once studied with her.
If he defeated Sirone with the incarnation technique here, he would be able to regain the title of the world’s greatest Kudo family.
‘It’s not only Hugo’s fault.’
After reading the hostility in her cousins’ eyes, Sirone realized where Hugo’s twisted core began.
‘There is no teacher here.’
There was no way Cassia, the head of the household, would not know what her son was thinking, but he left for Zion with everyone.
To protect mankind from demons.
‘thank you.’
Sirone’s eyes changed.
‘I will correct Hugo.’
The cousins withdrew pale faces.
“Ugh! what, what?”
Even if her discipline was shallow, there was no way she wouldn’t feel the chill that froze the Sky family and even her heart.
Shirone, who had lost Yahweh’s warmth, was a perfect wizard in the eyes of Garcia, a certified first-class wizard.
‘Is this really a wizard of terms and conditions?’
Like absolute zero, a spirit without the slightest movement was extreme cold.
“Huh, how are you? Are you going to finish it?”
Minerva stood next to Garcia.
“A terribly pure, terribly cold spirit zone. Isn’t that the state of mind that every wizard dreams of?”
“… … I can understand Yuugo’s heart.”
I wanted to feel it just once.
“To be able to remain unswayed by all stimuli… … How would you feel?”
“It’s easy to give up. Also, the wizard should be like that. Aren’t you much more handsome than when you were Yahweh?”
Garcia shuts her mouth at the nonsensical sound.
“let’s go. I want to finish quickly.”
As Sirone’s voice made the Spirit Zone vibrate, Hugo’s heart felt clear and frozen.
‘Sheesh, what is it? Or suppress the steamer.’
An infinite wizard who has mastered all magic in the world.
If you collide with pure spirit, you will not be an opponent.
“I’ll say it again, it’s a showdown of incarnation. The use of magic is against each other… … .”
“know. Guide me to the place where we will fight.”
Hugo turned to the training ground.
“Follow me.”
After casting the fly magic, Sirone, Minerva, Garcia and her cousins followed.
‘joy! It’s all about pretending to be proud!’
The place where Hugo arrived was a vast vacant lot where it was easy to focus on the art of incarnation.
There was no wall visible all the way to the horizon, and this was also a place specially supported by South Eymond.
“now! Since we’re here, let’s start quickly!”
Minerva, who cheered up with a round of applause, turned to Garcia and asked.
“Bet, are you really not going to? Isn’t it because you can’t bet on a promising player from your country?”
“I don’t gamble on the suffering of others.”
Garcia said firmly.
“But if you’re simply asking for an opinion, I’d like to raise Hugo’s hand.”
“Ho-ho-ho! The pride lives on.”
“… … Will it be so?”
I don’t mean to disparage Oh Dae-seong’s skills, but Hugo has spent his entire life fighting virtual mazes.
‘The incarnation created in that way.’
The reason there are no permanent winners is that latecomers can analyze and absorb the best.
Today was the day when Hugo’s efforts bore fruit.
“Direct attacks on the flesh are prohibited. Only battles between incarnations determine the outcome.”
There was nothing to worry about at the level of the two of them, but the impact on their minds would have been considerable.
“okay.”
As Sirone unfolded the sequence ceremony, the incarnation of the light angel rose hugely as if piercing the sky.
Hugo’s cousins widened their eyes.
“Wow.”
As the scenery shook grotesquely under the influence of the time period, I was on the verge of getting motion sickness.
“Nice.”
Hugo, now showing his teeth, performed incarnation with a blatant sneer.
“Then let me show you my weapon.”
As the sequence unfolded, smoke as thick as white paint rose up on Hugo’s shoulders.
“Heavenly Knight.”
The smoke rising to the height of the light angel turned into a knight covered in white armor.
It was a sleek shape that seemed to focus on mobility, and the surface of the armor was smooth as if it had been coated.
She was slender enough to be considered a woman, and she was holding a 9-meter long sword in both hands.
‘The size is big, but it’s clear. It will take a lot of power to break that thing.’
For the Sky family, who has been studying the state since birth, the sequence ceremony was the field they were most confident in.
“How about this? It is the incarnation of a celestial knight. I don’t think I will be ashamed to face Oh Dae-seong.”
To facilitate the incarnation’s confrontation, Sirone moved more than 300 meters away from Hugo.
“… … Let’s begin.”
At the attitude of ignoring it until the end, Hugo wrinkled his nose and developed the art of incarnation.
“You won’t even be able to follow it with your eyes!”
It was dizzy just to see the 20-meter-tall incarnation approaching in an instant.
‘finished!’
The moment the Celestial Knight crosses his swords with an X and cuts the light angel’s head, you exhale deeply.
“Pooh!”
1 second to here.
The surroundings of the light angel rapidly distorted, and suddenly it floated higher than the celestial knight.
‘Angel’s Punishment!’
Just as a single flash of light rushed toward the broad back of the celestial knight, Yuugo widened his eyes.
‘I already know!’
As the front and back sides of the incarnation wearing white armor were reversed, it flew straight toward the light angel.
‘Dump!’
The celestial knight’s side bent in an impossible trajectory, avoiding the angel’s punishment.
While the powerful impact swept the ground, the two swords stretched beyond count and stabbed the light angel.
“Keugh!”
Sirone’s brow narrowed.
“This is not the end!”
The white armor that made up the celestial knight churned like liquid and charged in every pose imaginable.
‘This… … !,
Sirone finally realized.
“Can I avoid my dump?”
Three swords flew in from all angles and stabbed the incarnation of the light angel.
Each one was a one-hit kill, and a huge shock was sent to Shirone’s mind, who was using incarnation art.
“Whoa!”
Sirone’s eyes were still clear.
‘You’re holding on like this? Well, you won’t break.’
The corner of Yuugo’s mouth lengthened.
“Suffer forever.”
The heavenly knight completely disintegrated the body and attacked the light angel in an unimaginable form.
“… … It’s quite the incarnation.”
Minerva, who had been watching with a cold expression like a snake, let out a long puff of cigarette smoke.
“The collapse of form is the collapse of logic. In other words, you can print the thought itself?”
“It is the law called dump.”
Garcia said.
“Hugo can print anything he thinks through the Celestial Knight.”
is such a law.
“Even if the sense of suddenness expands the present, the reaction itself is nothing more than a result after the cause. But dump… … .”
“Cause and effect are output simultaneously.”
“That’s it.”
It was possible if it was spirit, not physics, and incarnation was the expression of its unique personality.
“To jump through the maze?”
Hugo’s psychology is Minerva, but it was the first fact that came to mind when he saw the heavenly knight.
‘The position of contemplation that accepts and understands all angles of the world, that is Miro’s Thousand Arms Guanyin.’
On the other hand, the heavenly knight was the position of divergence expressed by Hugo to the world.
“He is an incarnation of the Sky family’s temperament. In terms of the depth of realization, I think it is second to none.”
“joy.”
Minerva snorted, but that was the only response she could respond to Garcia’s words.
‘Win! I win!’
The Celestial Knight was clearly showing the collapse of logic and the form of the whole idea being output.
never been beautiful
However, it was the most functional form in the universe because it was completely alien to human aesthetic sense.
‘Shall I tell you what is really scary?’
If it’s just a dump, it might be funny depending on the level.
“Sky’s reasoning fills the sky.”
The heavenly knight struck the light angel in a way that blocked all trajectories, even the variables of time.
Numerous sharp swords were embedded in the light angel’s body to the extent that there was no place to stab them anymore.
“Big uh… … !”
A moan escaped from Sirone’s mouth, and cold sweat formed on his forehead.
“Is the reason you hold on is your pride?”
The Celestial Knight pulled out his three swords and retreated.
“It’s disappointing. If you knew you couldn’t win, it would be a beautiful sight to just admit it.”
“okay. Really strong.”
Sirone slowly looked up.
“If I admit defeat here, are you satisfied now?”
“Don’t talk nonsense.”
The celestial knight unleashed Yuugo’s anger and stretched out numerous thorns.
“How dare you invent an excuse to escape?”
Sirone gritted his teeth as he looked at the shape of the Unlocker’s thoughts pouring in.
‘It’s much more twisted than I thought.’
I didn’t intend to do it moderately from the beginning.
‘I’m sorry, Mr. Cassia… … .’
From now on, even a confrontation between incarnations was an area where Hugo’s life could not be guaranteed.
‘I guess this is the only way.’
When I first realized this, I thought it would be of no use except for me.
‘Angel’s Punishment!’
The light angel lowered the spear.
“It’s no use!”
As Yugo’s thoughts were printed, the heavenly knight evaded the light spear in an extraordinary form.
‘This is 1 second.’
The light angels made up of time period rapidly changed their shape as they went through the stages of thinning, granularity, and resonance.
‘And this timeline… … .’
Sirone gritted his teeth and invoked incarnation.
‘It bounces!’
Light Angel’s Incarnation Technique – Time Vibration.
“what… … !”
Even in a fleeting moment enough to be called the smallest unit of time, Hugo’s thoughts were formed by squeezing through the gaps.
‘Why are you coming again?’
What made it all the more incomprehensible was that in this short moment, the punishment of the angels was flying again.
‘Dump… … !’
Hugo realized what this was when he dodged the 3,000th spear with all his might.
‘The same time is vibrating.’
The time that has still passed is the beginning of an instant.
‘How long… … .’
At the point where Article 1 is repeated for the 6,281st time, Yugo’s reasoning finally reached its limit.
‘Now I don’t know.’
The moment I let go of the string of cognition that was pulling me tight, time passed by the standard of my five senses.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
The mind seems to be destroyed.
In such a distant consciousness, the last reason Hugo realized was the infinite repetition of a specific second.
It was a shock that the time of each different event vibrates 100,000 times per second.

[77] Return of the Archmage (4)
“Could you give me a little more detail?”
Please enable JavaScript
“The incident happened a week ago. The escaped prisoner is a man named Lucas, and he was the vice-captain of the parrot thieves before he was captured. The leader is currently wanted.”
“Don’t you know the impression of the person who attacked Inferno other than the escaped prisoner?”
“Um, well. I’ve only heard rumors. I heard that you are an old man with gray hair. It seems that there were 2 seeds. They say he got the prisoners out with dark magic. What was that, I think it was something of darkness… … .”
“A power of darkness?”
“yes that’s right! After all, you are a magic school teacher.”
Reina raised her voice, but THAAD did not listen. dark magic. Inferno was also attacked by an old man who casts the Power of Darkness, an advanced technology.
‘no way?’
Sad shook his head.
“sorry. Let’s go first.”
“yes? Ah yes.”
Being polite until the end was close to instinct. In Saad’s eyes, neither the party nor the beautiful woman were visible anymore.
‘Damn it! Of course, when I’m on a business trip!’
He said the jailbreak was a week ago. It would have been enough time to reach Creas if he had moved from Baska without stopping.
“carriage! carriage!”
After leaving the mansion, Sade got on any carriage waiting in line. Then she opened the window of the driver’s seat and shouted.
“Until Creas! ASAP!”
“Cows, guests, and carriages here are all reserved. If you are not on the list, you cannot attend… … .”
Since it was a carriage for a high-ranking official, he couldn’t change his mind with a decent amount of money.
Saad searched his pockets and took out all the money he had.
“ruler! take it Are you going to go or not?”
The coachman, who counted the number of gold coins scattered on the box seat, immediately corrected his expression and prepared to set off.
“I will see you soon. Are you passing the night?”
“I need neither sleep nor rest! Please go quickly!”
The cheerful sound of horses hooves pounded the night air.
“shit! I shouldn’t be late.”
Saad leaned back against the backrest and touched his forehead. I wanted to leap by moving space, but I didn’t have enough lives even if I had to cast it in a row in a foreign place where I didn’t know the coordinates or the environment.
The fact that I couldn’t do anything made me regain my composure. As the situation was understood, this time I had a question.
With what intention did he reappear in the world?
Sade has never met him or seen his face. However, the terrible bond he heard from Alfeas was vivid in his memory.
“Viltor Arcane… … .”
Saad’s eyes stared straight ahead, burning.
* * *
It was past 4:00 in the morning, and Canis and the others entered the training ground halfway up the mountain at Alpheas Magic School.
I had never attended a magic school, but I could see that it was a top-notch facility as a disciple of an archmage.
A frivolous voice broke the silence.
“Whee, you built it well. You’ve been plastered with gold coins. How much are you going to pay for the land?”
Kanis frowned and turned his head. Lucas, a Class B wanted man, had a pair of parrot-engraved swords slung over her shoulders.
“Keep your voice down. The guards might be patrolling.”
“What are you worried about? You can’t cut it off. You can bury it.”
Canis felt even worse. He was a human being who accompanied Master according to his will, but did not have a single favorite corner.
“Aren’t you mistaken? you are hired by us If there is a setback in the operation, I will not leave you alone.”
“Whoa, be scared. Kids these days are good. I meet a great teacher and talk badly to adults.”
Lucas slumps down on the training ground. Canis suppressed his anger as he did not interfere with the operation any longer.
‘The most important thing is Master’s revenge. Even if I don’t like it, I have no choice but to endure it.’
Lucas asked, yawning.
“Why are we waiting here anyway? You have to go down to school anyway.”
Arin expressed his disgust and said.
“Master will cast a spell. Because it’s wide-area magic, we won’t be safe if we get in range. He can go down first if he’s confident, but hey.”
Lucas shrugged. He was honest about wanting to avoid arcane magic.
“Hehe, don’t be too angry, little girl. Your cute face looks ugly.”
“Heh, it doesn’t matter how you look or not.”
“Shouldn’t you be dating my uncle? I can teach you something more fun than magic.”
Canis cut off the conversation just as Arin, who was blushing, couldn’t stand it and was about to shout.
“quiet. This is the beginning.”
Canis and the others’ gaze turned to the sky. Arcane was floating in the center of the moon with fly magic cast.
Fly is a fusion magic that uses two types of air, press and blow, at the same time. First, press-type magic creates solid air pressure around it, and then blow-type magic generates wind to generate lift. Thanks to the merit of flying, it is classified as overpowered, but since the wind changes in real time, a delicate sense was essential.
As the darkness came and covered the moon, Arcane’s concentrated eyes opened. Combining omniscience and omnipotence, he spread his limbs and cast Abyss Nova, the masterpiece of his life.
There were no roars and no terrifying aftershocks, but the sight of darkness covering the school was spectacular.
When the effect of Abyss Nova spread to the outskirts of the magic school disappeared, the moon appeared again and the son-in-law became brighter.
“Whoa. Whoa.”
Arcane let out a heavy breath. It was a gigantic magic that required 90% of his mental power to be consumed even by the great wizard.
‘It must be difficult to raise for the time being.’
Arcane turned and headed for the mountain. He had a hard time even maintaining his fly magic, but his rage grew stronger.
As long as Abyss Nova spreads, there is no one to disturb him. Besides, didn’t he raise disciples in preparation for such a situation?
“Cheuk, wait, Alfeas. I will let you taste the humiliation of 40 years ago.”
The dark night passed, and a faint light was rising from the eastern foot of the mountain.
Dark Intruder (1)
It was the last day of suspension. After studying until dawn at the inn, Sirone and the others woke up long after morning. After making fun of each other for a while, they took a bath.
By the time I returned the books to the library and went to school, lunch break was over. It was class time, so the campus was quiet, and cleaners were sweeping the stone roads.
“This is the end, our vacation.”
“What about vacation? Is a suspension a vacation?”
“You had fun, though. what are you going to do now?”
Sirone turned to the inn and said.
“I’m going to go in and start tidying up the room. I have class from tomorrow, so I have to clean it up today.”
“Anyway, I need to know what to be strict about. okay. Then we’ll be at the study group, so come if you’re bored.”
“okay. See you later.”
After parting with her friends, Sirone returned to her lodgings. While he was preparing for the recital, the room was a mess because he wasn’t paying attention. He rolled up his sleeves and started cleaning, putting his class materials in order into the bookshelf, and finally shaking his hands.
A one-week suspension that came without notice.
But I did gain something. No, it was a realization beyond what I had learned so far in school.
‘It’s finally normal class. I hope tomorrow comes soon.’
It was only natural that my progress was delayed, and I intended to focus on my classes even if I had to reduce my study group activities for the time being.
‘Nade and Iruki must be the same.’
The eyes of the friends I saw at the inn were burning with a passion for learning. It was thanks to the clear goal of being promoted to Class Four by the end of this semester.
At the end of each semester, Alpheas Magic School decides who will be promoted by reflecting the grades of the first half of the semester, and the cut-off was over 80 points in all subjects. It was a terrifying level of difficulty where you had to score 80 points or more in all subjects, not an average of 80 points.
Of course, it was not an impossible score, but it was true that it was difficult for any student. This is because there are bound to be weak subjects depending on individual aptitude.
Nevertheless, the school’s educational policy was firm.
Acquiring knowledge in all fields to a certain level or higher before entering a major.
So, if you were a graduate of a magic school, you had to see that you could use all the basic magic of each series. It was also the reason why graduates were given preferential treatment in the forefront of the magical society.
Not all current wizards graduated from magic schools. The percentage of students from non-magical schools who became disciples of wizards, gained enlightenment, or learned magic through the dark route could not be ignored.
Their strengths are that they have a lot of experience in the field and use magic suitable for practice. However, there were also disadvantages of lack of understanding of magic and low potential for development compared to those who graduated from magic schools.
Who to hire depends on the nature of the job, but it was true that graduates from magic schools had an advantage in getting a job. As such, the 80 points presented by the school was a standard considering the modern social situation.
“ha. So what? In my case, it means that you have to raise your average by at least 30 points.”
No matter what realization Sirone had, this was a school. In order to be promoted, a score of 80 or more was required.
It is not impossible if you use the framework of knowledge. In addition, if you prepare for the presentation and reinforce the knowledge you have gained while studying God Particles, your score will increase considerably.
But even considering that, I thought the probability of being promoted was about 30 percent.
‘No, isn’t it rather great? If it’s 30% to be promoted to Class 4 in half a year.’
Sirone thought positively. Isn’t that a good enough chance to try? If Nade and Iruki are promoted and only you remain in Class 5… … The thought alone was terrifying.
In addition, once you enter Class Four, you will be able to apply for the senior class. In that case, she would also keep her promise to Amy.
“omg! right! Amy!”
We never met after the presentation. At the time, she was so excited that she didn’t even think about finding her.
‘Oh, I should have said hello. I was too careless.’
Amy was a grateful friend who supported me whenever I faced a difficult challenge. She said she would be her strength this time. As she walks out of her lodgings with such thoughts, it is in Shirone’s eyes that her playfulness is childish.
“Whoops! Will you be surprised?”
* * *
Sirone headed to her senior year with two cups of coffee in each hand. One belonged to Amy, and the other belonged to Seriel. A bitter smile appeared on her lips as she recalled the past of running Amy’s coffee errands.
‘At that time, I really thought the world was collapsing.’
Looking back, it was a bad relationship.
Who knew that the poor girl he met in an alley at the age of twelve would now be friends with?
Sirone climbed the hill of the senior class. An arch called a steel door stood at the entrance. I didn’t know it when I saw it from a distance, but it was a much bigger structure than I thought.
‘This is the pinnacle of magic school.’
Passing under the structure that symbolizes the wizard’s spirit, Sirone’s heart somehow became solemn.
When the 6th period class ended, the seniors came out. Sirone shouted when he found Amy and Seriel conversing on the main porch.
“Amy! Amy!”
The seniors turned their heads, but Amy and Seriel were still engrossed in the conversation as if they hadn’t heard. Then, Sirone, who was playful, went behind her and held out coffee in front of Amy’s eyes.
“Voila! Surprise!”
Amy opened her eyes wide in surprise. Sirone gave her coffee to Seriel with her big smile.
“Here, I also have seniors. Eat this and cheer up!”
Seriel tilted her head. Amy blinked her eyes as well, and she said with a frown.
“What are you? Who is giving us coffee?”

[770] Apostasy (5)
As the spear of light penetrated the heavenly knight, the ground swayed like a wave.
Because the mass was adjusted, the power of the wave was not exerted, but the speed was much faster.
“Aaaaaa… … .”
The moment when Hugo was about to fall to the ground as both knees were slammed down by the powerful shock at the same time.
“Huh!”
He raised his elbow to keep his face from being slammed.
‘I am… … .’
The spasm of the brain was transmitted through the nerves, and it was only after a long time that what had happened was analyzed.
‘How long have you been locked up?’
only 1 second.
However, Hugo’s head contained the memory of repeating one second 100,000 times.
Hugo’s cousins murmured.
“What happened?”
Angel’s Punishment is a world-famous incarnation technique, but the situation in which Yuugo fell in one blow was unconvincing.
So was Garcia.
‘I don’t know. What the hell happened?’
Hugo was also one of the best players in the world as well as Nam Eymond.
Moreover, if it was a showdown of incarnation rather than attacking the main body, it would be hard to get such a shock no matter what he did.
“Can you guess?”
The fact that Garcia had spoken to them first gave an idea of the absurd atmosphere of the place.
said Minerva.
“vibration.”
Across the river, the disrespectful face disappeared and before she knew it, she had the cold eyes of a witch.
“… … .”
Garcia savored her words.
Even though he only uttered one word, the head of the Magic Association reached a conclusion after going through countless possibilities.
“A second, is it vibrating?”
“okay. Bounce the timeline. The line goes back and forth from A to B countless times, but in the end, the width of the vibration is 1 second. However, in that 1-second vibration, countless 1-seconds are distributed with probability.”
Garcia was just listening.
“Then the question is, how did Hugo, the person in charge, accept this vibration?”
Cousins took notice.
“The bottom line is cognitive dissonance. It is highly likely that he felt both an instant and an eternity at the same time.”
Even just listening to the explanation seemed to create cognitive dissonance.
one of the cousins asked.
“How is that possible?”
Minerva waved her index finger up and down.
“These are the vibrations of the timeline. Even if you try to feel a second at a specific point between these vibrations… … .”
The fingers kept moving.
“There is not a second there. The fingers have already passed and only the probabilities remain.”
That’s why it’s a moment.
“Conversely, if you feel one second at a specific point.”
The finger stopped.
“It is no longer a oscillation because the probability collapses.”
Garcia said.
“100 percent chance. It really becomes one second.”
so forever
“The result depends on the intention of the observer. However, Hugo vibrated with Sirone’s one second. In other words, resonance.”
Minerva folded her thumb and forefinger in turn.
“Thus, Hugo had two experiences at the same time. One is the experience of 100,000 seconds rushing into one second. And another… … .”
Now Garcia understood.
“An experience of 100,000 seconds where one second repeats itself. This is why it feels both fleeting and eternity at the same time.”
Minerva lowered her hand.
“Strictly speaking, it’s neither a moment nor a vibration. Because there is currently no name for the time Hugo felt.”
Sirone called it Time Vibration.
“But looking at Hugo’s expression, I can fully imagine what that experience was like.”
Hugo, who still had a bewildered face, was terrified at his own speechless appearance.
‘Am I going to be stupid?’
Replaying a deadly battle, especially the fiercest moment 100,000 times, was a memory I never wanted to experience again.
“are you okay?”
Hearing Sirone’s voice, Hugo slowly raised his gaze and looked up at Sirone.
“… … .”
Horrible memories rushed through the vibrations, his eyes quivering with fear, and he fell back.
“Huh… … .”
Sirone looked at Hugo with a pitiful expression.
‘This is why I didn’t want to write it to anyone else.’
It was a means to counter Nane’s emptiness.
‘Unification of Shipok and Bakji.’
Sirone’s metacognition can sense ideas and handle all information in the world in an integrated manner.
‘That’s the mouth.’
And now it has reached the stage of shaking the world by vibrating the entire information through resonance.
“If I could shake the world.”
If the timeline of the world we live in goes back and forth endlessly between points A and B.
“The past and future overlap.”
As the present disappears, this world is released into a world of probability without any fixed values.
“Therefore, there is neither a future that always comes, nor a past that can never be returned.”
A kind of time slip.
“To create the phenomenon of reversing time.”
Hugo slowly raised his head and saw Sirone with a sad expression in his eyes.
“This is what I do against my balls… … .”
although it is still insufficient.
“It was the only way to save the whole thing.”
Hugo’s face turned into a tear-stain, and clear tears flowed down his cheeks.
‘What have I done?’
Yahweh of philanthropy.
He was a man with a burden that could not tolerate even a single misfortune in the world.
‘father.’
The depth of the realm is not everything.
‘I was foolish.’
When he realized how wide Sirone’s heart was, he began to feel ashamed of his narrowed heart.
“Go to Zion.”
Sirone held out his hand.
“It was a great incarnation. let’s fight together The world needs people like you.”
“ah… … .”
I was finally speechless.
“thank you.”
Seeing Hugo shed tears, the cousins also shut up to see if there was anything they realized.
said Minerva.
“You think it’s only one second?”
Garcia didn’t think so, but after hearing what he said, he didn’t even feel like denying it.
“You cannot save the whole by repeating the moment. However, not all demons can be eliminated. but… … .”
Minerva remembered Veron.
“A man threw a hwadu into this world and left. Can a human being change his future with his own will?”
“It’s a Veron problem. If the outcome has already been determined by the law, Nane’s credit must also be right.”
“That’s why it’s not just one second.”
Sirone’s answer to Veron’s question was ‘yes’.
“It destroyed the predetermined future. It was a direct challenge to my enlightenment.”
If the future is of a destructible nature.
“We have entered a stage where we cannot know whether the world is really suffering unless we go to the end.”
Sirone came closer, supporting Hugo.
“Just relax and you’ll be fine.”
As the cousins took Hugo away, Sirone turned to Minerva and said,
“Stop going. I was too late.”
Garcia has arrived.
“Thank you on behalf of Hugo. If you need help in the future, please come back anytime.”
Minerva raised her ax eye.
“hey! You never said anything like that to me? Dare to cover the five great castles for the sake of a mere head of the Magic Association?”
‘They should be treated like people.’
Seeing Sirone made him hate Minerva even more.
“I’m glad that Hugo is safe. It would be great if even one more person could help Zion.”
Garcia spoke for the first time.
“yes. Currently, Gustaf’s movements are unusual, and the temple is also recruiting talent from all over the world. I plan to apply for Valkyrie soon.”
“yes? Are you the president of the association?”
“It has not been finalized yet, but I intend to test it. It’s time to join forces. Of course, it’s not that I didn’t think about my personal career or the honor of the kingdom.”
“Ah, of course it is.”
Not everyone had to be Yahweh.
‘If you’re the world’s best fire mage, you’ll easily pass the test. No, maybe it’s a free pass.’
Sirone did not express himself.
“I hope for good results. I look forward to seeing you again someday.”
That’s what Garcia wanted to say.
“I wish you luck.”
The jet carrying Sirone spewed fire terrifyingly and flew across the sky at Mach speed.
Watching the temple quickly move away, Sirone turned to Minerva.
“Are you going to the ivory tower?”
“It should be. Time vibration itself is a fallacy. maybe something will come out Then, I think it will be in a few days before we leave for Kasan?”
“What is taking so long to come out?”
“If you listen, you will know.”
I didn’t want to get involved with Terraforce.
“Instead, I’ll take care of trivial matters. There is also Nam Eymond’s case, and the registration of <Slaughter>.”
“Are you going to register <Slaughter>?”
Oh Dae-sung, whose satellites are impossible to find, can register one more thing besides himself in the Ivory Tower.
“No matter how much it is to punish the atrocities, it is a super-special murder weapon. You have to be listed in the ivory tower to be able to use it freely. Otherwise, there will be a huge backlash worldwide.”
“aha.”
“I’ll entrust you with <Slaughter>. Maybe I’ve finally found the right owner… … .”
It was an inappropriately sentimental statement.
‘Well, to Minerva-san, ‘Slaughter’ is… … .’
It was not easy to give someone an object that contained all the terrible pain and ugly past.
“By the way, what is your wish?”
“huh?”
“You lost the bet. What is your wish?”
Minerva grinned.
“Are you looking forward to it?”
Sirone firmly shook her hand.
“you’re welcome. It is better to sell quickly. I don’t think it’s a normal wish.”
Do you have any wishes for Oh Dae-seong?
“Hmm, good.”
Minerva turned away from the jet and looked at Sirone’s lips with honey dripping eyes.
“What do you do with this?”
Just as Sirone shuddered, Minerva spread two fingers.
“I will give you a choice. What you can do here and what you can do later. Take your pick.”
‘What can I do here now?’
Sirone, who was writing down the list in her head, swallowed and said.
“It has to be done later. So, you can do it now, but that doesn’t include putting it off until later, right?”
“To be wicked. Of course, most of the things I like can be done here. But what if it’s like a wedding? Can’t you do that here?”
“… … Are you sane?”
Minerva smiled coolly.
“I’m kidding. good anyway A successful bid with something that can only be done later! Did you promise me?”
“I need to know what it is.”
As the jet pierced the clouds, Minerva pondered with a dim gaze.
“Time Vibration”
“yes?”‘
“Maybe later… … If you really get a chance to save everyone… … .”
Sirone listened intently to the unprecedentedly serious voice, but she hurriedly shook her head.
“I’d also like to save it. Wouldn’t that make it more difficult? I’ll tell you when the time comes.”
“Where is that? What is it?”
The reason Minerva kept silent was not for her sake, but for Sirone’s sake.
‘Because you won’t accept it.’
life pain.
She is traveling along with Sirone, but in fact, her essence was close to Nane’s philosophy.
‘Don’t save me, Sirone.’
That’s what I really wanted to ask for.
“Oh, really! If you keep doing this, I’ll make it a wish and something that didn’t exist! It’s not like you’re drugging people.”
She smiled spontaneously at Sirone’s voice, but there were water droplets in her eyes.
‘I have to wipe it.’
A witch’s heart that can never be cleansed.
‘I have to wipe it with moonlight.’
The Akkadian Desert of the northern continent was approaching in their sight as they passed the Mediterranean Sea.
